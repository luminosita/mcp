#### Section 6.1
- [ ] are these two different prompts or one using the other?

## Questions (AI)

### Step 1

Gap Analysis Report: Context Engineering Proof-of-Concept

  1. Analysis Summary

  I've parsed the advanced prompt engineering research document and extracted Context Engineering topics relevant to the proof-of-concept. The document provides comprehensive coverage of:

  - Foundational patterns: Structured prompts with 5 core components (persona, task, context, exemplars, format)
  - Advanced techniques: Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thoughts, Self-Refine, Chain-of-Verification
  - Documentation templates: PRD, ADR, Technical Specs, User Stories
  - Code generation: Security-first patterns, frontend/backend/IaC/testing templates
  - Validation frameworks: RAGAS metrics (adapted for non-RAG), quality checklists

  2. SDLC Phase Mapping

  Vision/Planning → PRD generation, gap analysis, clarification patterns
  Design → Architecture Decision Records, Technical Specifications, API specs
  Implementation → Code generation (frontend/backend/IaC), security templates
  Testing → Unit test generation, code review automation, TDD workflows

  3. Critical Gaps Identified

  Gap 1: Scope Definition for "Proof-of-Concept" Deliverables

  Impact: CriticalIssue: The kickoff command requests a PoC but doesn't specify:
  - Should we generate artifacts for a real example project (e.g., "build a todo app") or abstract templates?
  - How many iterations are required to demonstrate "iterative learning" (goal G2)?
  - What constitutes "measurable improvement" in iteration quality?

  Gap 2: Validation Criteria Operationalization

  Impact: HighIssue: Success criteria reference:
  - "Flesch score >60" — requires automated readability scoring tool (not in scope)
  - "Traceability" — needs defined format (e.g., markdown reference links? structured metadata?)
  - "Actionability" — subjective without clear rubric

  Gap 3: CLAUDE.md Orchestration Strategy Ambiguity

  Impact: MediumIssue: The research document mentions CLAUDE.md for persistent context but doesn't detail:
  - Routing logic: How does root CLAUDE.md "tell the agent" which specialized file to use? (Are we relying on file path conventions, explicit instructions, or something else?)
  - Context limits: What's the threshold for splitting contexts into specialized files vs. keeping in root?

  4. Proposed Assumptions (Pending Confirmation)

  Assumption A1: We'll build a concrete example project to generate real artifactsRationale: Abstract templates are already in the research doc; demonstrating end-to-end generation proves concept better.

  Assumption A2: 3 iterations = Initial generation → Self-critique → RefinementRationale: Aligns with Self-Refine pattern from research (Section 2.4).

  Assumption A3: Validation uses manual checklist (not automated scoring)Rationale: Automated Flesch scoring is out of scope; checklists are practical for PoC.

  Assumption A4: CLAUDE.md routing uses explicit directory referencesRationale: Root file contains: "For PRD generation, consult /docs/templates/prd/CLAUDE.md"

  5. Clarification Questions (Prioritized)

  Question 1 (Critical): What project should the PoC generate artifacts for?

  Options:
  - A) Simple web app (e.g., task manager with frontend + backend)
  - B) CLI tool (e.g., file processor)
  - C) Abstract "Feature X" using placeholder requirements
  - D) Other (please specify)

  Impact: Determines scope of all generated artifacts (PRDs, specs, code).

  Question 2 (High): How should we measure "iterative improvement" for Goal G2?

  Options:
  - A) Manual comparison checklist (iteration 1 vs. 2 vs. 3)
  - B) Specific metrics (e.g., # of missing sections, # of security issues found)
  - C) Narrative summary showing learnings applied
  - D) Other (please specify)

  Impact: Defines success criteria for primary goal.

  Question 3 (Medium): Should specialized CLAUDE.md files be created proactively or on-demand?

  Options:
  - A) Proactive: Create all specialized files upfront (e.g., /docs/templates/prd/CLAUDE.md, /code/backend/CLAUDE.md)
  - B) On-demand: Create only when a task requires >500 tokens of specialized context
  - C) Hybrid: Pre-create for major SDLC phases, on-demand for edge cases

  Impact: Affects folder structure and initial setup time.

  6. Next Steps

  ⚠️ Paused at ANALYZE phase — awaiting your responses to clarification questions before proceeding to CONFIRM/GENERATE phases.

  **Human Response**:
  - All proposed assumptions are correct
  - We are creating CLI tool. Product details should be created as part of Product Vision generation task. 
  - My understanding of the research document is that we generally need a sophisticated prompt for each phase/step/task of the process. Maybe that is an overkill. Iterative proof of concept project should clarify that assumption. 
  - One of the tasks should be creation of Product Vision Generator prompt followed by that prompt execution. As a result we will get Product Vision template in the form of a sophisticated reusable prompt stored in the folder structure.
  - Another assumption of mine is that each task must be executed in a standalone context. 
  - The only activity performed within this current context should be project initial plan generation as a very first step of Context Engineering framework.
  - Yet another assumption of mine is that the basis of Context Engineering framework is the tree of sophisticated prompts generating sub-prompts for the future phases/steps/tasks and that each template artifact is essentially a prompt generating sub-artifacts.
  - **CRITICAL** Iterative execution of subsequent tasks within standalone contexts
  - We should update our priorities and first establish the clear understanding of the general product creation strategy based on the main research document. That is my understanding of Goal G2, the workflow is prompts generating PAP (product artifacts prompt -> product artifacts + sub-artifacts generator prompt)
  - **CRITICAL** Analyze my response, and perform clarification loop by asking questions until clear strategy/workflow is established
  - Success criteria for G2 would be clear Context Engineering strategy/workflow document
  - Specialized CLAUDE.md files should be created right before execution of the specialized task requiring information from those CLAUDE.md files
  - Each task context should contain main CLAUDE.md file, specialized CLAUDE.md file (by instruction provided in the main CLAUDE.md) at the minimum. 
  - Outcome of this step can also affect the initial context for this session and result in the update of the prompt

  ### Step 2

  ⏺ Clarification Loop: Context Engineering Strategy

  Analysis of Your Response

  I've identified several key insights that shift the project paradigm:

  Core Paradigm Shift

  From: Generate artifacts using pre-written promptsTo: Generate prompts that generate prompts (recursive meta-prompt architecture)

  Critical Insights Extracted

  1. Standalone Context Execution: Each task runs in fresh Claude Code session
  2. Prompt-as-Artifact: Templates ARE sophisticated prompts, not just markdown documents
  3. Recursive Generation: Product Vision Generator Prompt → executes → produces Product Vision Template Prompt
  4. This Session's Scope: Only produce initial project plan, then exit
  5. Success = Strategy Document: Not working software, but validated workflow methodology

  Clarification Questions (Round 1)

  Q1: Recursive Prompt Depth - How Deep?

  Based on your "tree of sophisticated prompts" concept, I need to understand the generation chain:

  Example Chain A (3 levels):
  Meta-Prompt Generator (this session)
    ↓ generates
  Product Vision Generator Prompt
    ↓ generates (in standalone context)
  Product Vision Document

  Example Chain B (4 levels):
  Meta-Prompt Generator (this session)
    ↓ generates
  Product Vision Generator Prompt
    ↓ generates (in standalone context)
  Product Vision Template + Epic Generator Prompt
    ↓ generates (in another standalone context)
  Epic 1 Document + User Story Generator Prompts

  Question: Which depth model aligns with your vision?
  - A) Fixed 3-level: Meta → Generator → Artifact
  - B) Variable depth: Stop when artifact is "terminal" (e.g., source code file)
  - C) SDLC-aligned: One level per phase (Vision → Epic → Story → Spec → Code → Test)
  - D) Other (please specify)

  ---
  Q2: Prompt Storage & Retrieval Strategy

  You mentioned:
  "Each task context should contain main CLAUDE.md file, specialized CLAUDE.md file"

  Scenario: Executing "Product Vision Generator Prompt" in standalone context

  Question: What files should exist when that new session starts?

  Option A (Minimal):
  /CLAUDE.md (root orchestration)
  /prompts/product_vision_generator.xml (the prompt to execute)

  Option B (With Research):
  /CLAUDE.md (root)
  /prompts/product_vision_generator.xml
  /docs/advanced_prompt_engineering_software_docs_code_final.md (research doc)
  /prompts/CLAUDE.md (specialized instructions for prompt execution)

  Option C (Cumulative):
  /CLAUDE.md (root)
  /prompts/product_vision_generator.xml
  /docs/advanced_prompt_engineering_software_docs_code_final.md
  /context/previous_outputs/ (all artifacts from prior tasks)

  Which option, or describe alternative?

  ---
  Q3: Task Execution Trigger Mechanism

  You stated:
  "Another assumption of mine is that each task must be executed in a standalone context"

  Question: How does task execution get triggered?

  Option A (Manual):
  1. This session generates /TODO.md with task list
  2. Human user manually starts new Claude Code session
  3. User provides /prompts/task_N_generator.xml as input
  4. Repeat for each task

  Option B (Semi-Automated):
  1. This session generates /TODO.md + execution script
  2. Script contains instructions like: "Open new session, paste prompt X, save output to Y"
  3. Human executes script steps manually

  Option C (Fully Automated - if possible):
  1. This session generates orchestration prompt
  2. Orchestration prompt contains: "After generating artifact X, spawn new context for task Y using prompt Z"
  3. Single execution chain (may violate Claude Code limitations?)

  Which approach, or describe alternative?

  ---
  Q4: Context Engineering Strategy Document Structure

  You defined Goal G2 success as:
  "Clear Context Engineering strategy/workflow document"

  Question: What sections should this strategy document contain?

  Proposed Structure (please modify/approve):

  # Context Engineering Strategy v1.0

  ## 1. Core Principles
  - Prompt-as-Artifact paradigm
  - Standalone context isolation
  - Recursive generation chains

  Approve structure, or specify required changes?

  ---
  Q5: Iteration Strategy for Proof-of-Concept

  You mentioned:
  "Iterative proof of concept project should clarify that assumption"

  Question: How many generation cycles should the PoC demonstrate?

  Scenario Example:
  Iteration 1: Generate Product Vision Generator Prompt → Execute → Get Vision v1
  Iteration 2: Critique Vision v1 → Refine Generator Prompt → Execute → Get Vision v2
  Iteration 3: Apply learnings → Update Strategy Doc → Re-generate → Get Vision v3

  Options:
  - A) 1 iteration per task (demonstrate breadth across SDLC)
  - B) 3 iterations on single task (demonstrate depth of refinement)
  - C) 2 iterations: Initial + one refinement cycle per task
  - D) Other (please specify)

  ---
  Next Steps After Clarification

  Once you answer Q1-Q5, I will:

  1. Synthesize answers into "Context Engineering Strategy Document" (Goal G2 deliverable)
  2. Generate:
    - /TODO.md (task sequence with dependencies)
    - /CLAUDE.md (root orchestration instructions)
    - /docs/context_engineering_strategy.md (the core methodology)
    - /prompts/product_vision_generator.xml (first meta-prompt as example)
  3. Present for approval before exiting this context
  4. Provide instructions for launching first standalone task context

  Status: Paused at CLARIFY phase, awaiting Q1-Q5 responses.

**Human Response**
Q1: I created Mermaid diagram for clarification

```mermaid
graph TD;
A["Master Prompt (this session)"] -->|GENERATES| P[Master Plan];
A -->|GENERATES| PVP[Product Vision Generator Prompt];

PVP -->|GENERATES| PVD["Product Vision Document (in separate context C1)"] 
PVP -->|GENERATES| EP["Epic Generator Prompt (in separate context C1)"]

EP -->|GENERATES| ED["Epic Document (in separate context C2)"] 
EP -->|GENERATES| PRP["PRD Generator Prompt (in separate context C2)"]

PRP -->|GENERATES| PRD["PRD (in separate context C3)"] 
PRP -->|GENERATES| USP["User Story Generator Prompt (in separate context C3)"]
```
**Notes**: 
- Product Vision Document is the final document not a template. It is based on the template defined in the main research document. If template is missing it should be separately generated and placed in the folder structure so that it can be referenced by PVP (Product Vision Generator Prompt). 
- Epic Document is the final document not a template. It is based on the template defined in the main research document. If template is missing it should be separately generated and placed in the folder structure so that it can be referenced by EP (Epic Generator Prompt). 
- PRD is the final document not a template. It is based on the template defined in the main research document. That template should be extracted from the document, finalized and placed in the folder structure so that it can be referenced by PRP (PRD Generator Prompt). 

Depth model should be SDLC-aligned: One level per phase (Vision → Epic → PRD → Story → (ADR + Spec + Implementation Task) → Code → Test)

---

Q2: Prompt Storage & Retrieval Strategy
New Option:
  /CLAUDE.md (root)
  /prompts/product_vision_generator.xml
  /prompts/CLAUDE-product-vision.md (specialized instructions for prompt execution)
  /prompts/templates/product-vision-template.xml (product vision template, generated or extracted from the main research document)
  /docs/product-idea.md (first draft of product idea, outlining input required by product vision generator prompt)
  /.claude/commands/execute-product-vision-generator.xml or /.claude/commands/execute-generator.xml (fixed execution prompt)

**Notes**:
- fixed execution prompt executes specific generator prompt, provided as an $ARGUMENT. 
- fixed execution prompt can be generic, capable of executing any generator prompt or tied to a specific type of generator prompt
- we might come up with additional documents during the process required by particular prompt
  
---

Q3: Task Execution Trigger Mechanism (excellent question)
This should be one of the main goal of this proof of concept project. The idea is in progression from Option A, to Option B, to Option C how our Context Engineering workflow matures. By the end of this project we should graduate trigger mechanism to Option C (with certain human check points involving validation of the results from the previous executions, we will define some threshold for automated execution)

---

Q4: Context Engineering Strategy Document Structure
Proposed document structure is good for the start. It will slightly evolve as we progress. 

---

Q5: Iteration Strategy for Proof-of-Concept

Option #3 → 3 iterations on single task (demonstrate depth of refinement) as covered in your Scenario Example

Scenario Example:
  Iteration 1: Generate Product Vision Generator Prompt → Execute → Get Vision v1
  Iteration 2: Critique Vision v1 → Refine Generator Prompt → Execute → Get Vision v2
  Iteration 3: Apply learnings → Update Strategy Doc → Re-generate → Get Vision v3

**Notes**:
- This approach should be applied for each SDLC phase until we perform final refinement of all our prompts and templates
- Update Strategy Doc iteration task is critical to keep the whole process on the right path

---

**CRITICAL** Analyze my response, and perform clarification loop by potentially asking questions until clear strategy/workflow is established
  

### Step 3

⏺ Clarification Loop Round 2: Deep Dive Analysis

  Analysis of Your Responses

  I've synthesized your answers and identified the emerging architecture. Several critical insights require validation:

  ---
  Key Architectural Patterns Identified

  Pattern 1: Dual Output Generators

  Every generator prompt produces:
  1. Terminal Artifact (e.g., Product Vision Document v1)
  2. Next-Level Generator Prompt (e.g., Epic Generator Prompt)

  This creates a self-propagating chain.

  Pattern 2: Template Hierarchy

  Research Document (immutable source)
    ↓ extract/generate
  Template Library (/prompts/templates/*.xml)
    ↓ referenced by
  Generator Prompts (/prompts/*_generator.xml)
    ↓ produces
  Final Documents (/artifacts/*)

  Pattern 3: Fixed Execution Harness

  /.claude/commands/execute-generator.xml acts as universal runtime that:
  - Loads specified generator prompt
  - Loads required templates
  - Loads specialized CLAUDE.md context
  - Executes generation
  - Saves outputs

  ---
  Critical Questions - Round 2

  Q6: Generator Prompt Output Format

  When product_vision_generator.xml executes, it must output two distinct artifacts:

  Scenario A (Single-file output):
  <output>
    <product_vision_document>
      # Product Vision: CLI File Processor
      [... full vision document ...]
    </product_vision_document>

    <epic_generator_prompt>
      <system_role>You are Epic decomposition specialist...</system_role>
      [... full next-level generator prompt ...]
    </epic_generator_prompt>
  </output>

  Scenario B (Separate file instructions):
  Generator outputs:
  1. /artifacts/product_vision_v1.md
  2. /prompts/epic_generator.xml

  Then prints: "Next step: Execute /kickoff execute-generator epic_generator"

  Question 6a: Which output pattern should generators use?

  Question 6b: Should the generator prompt itself specify output file paths, or should execute-generator.xml handle file routing based on naming conventions?

  ---
  Q7: Template Extraction Strategy

  You noted:
  "That template should be extracted from the document, finalized and placed in the folder structure"

  The research document contains templates in markdown format (Section 6.1 PRD, 6.2 ADR, etc.).

  Question 7a: Should templates be:
  - Option A: Copied verbatim from research doc as .md files
  - Option B: Converted to XML prompt format with <template> tags
  - Option C: Hybrid - Keep markdown template + wrap in XML with usage instructions

  Example Option B:
  <!-- /prompts/templates/prd-template.xml -->
  <template name="PRD" version="1.0">
    <instructions>
      Fill all sections marked [placeholder].
      Ensure SMART success metrics.
    </instructions>

    <structure>
      # [Product/Feature Name]

      ## Document Metadata
      - Author: [name]
      - Date: [date]
      ...
    </structure>
  </template>

  Question 7b: Who extracts templates?
  - Option A: Master Prompt (this session) extracts all templates upfront
  - Option B: Each generator prompt extracts its own template on first run
  - Option C: Manual extraction by human, stored in repo

  ---
  Q8: Iteration Refinement Mechanics

  Your iteration scenario:
  Iteration 1: Generate PVP → Execute → Get Vision v1
  Iteration 2: Critique Vision v1 → Refine PVP → Execute → Get Vision v2
  Iteration 3: Apply learnings → Update Strategy → Re-generate → Get Vision v3

  Critical ambiguity: What triggers Iteration 2?

  Scenario A (Human-triggered):
  1. Human reviews Vision v1
  2. Human writes critique notes in /feedback/vision_v1_critique.md
  3. Human runs: /kickoff refine-generator product_vision_generator
  4. System reads critique, updates PVP, re-executes

  Scenario B (Self-critique automated):
  1. execute-generator finishes Vision v1
  2. Automatically invokes critique-agent prompt
  3. Critique-agent generates /feedback/vision_v1_critique.md
  4. Automatically updates PVP based on critique
  5. Re-executes (up to 3 times or until quality threshold met)

  Question 8a: Which iteration trigger model for PoC?

  Question 8b: What constitutes "sufficient quality" to stop iterating?
  - Human approval checkbox?
  - Automated checklist pass rate (e.g., 8/10 criteria met)?
  - Fixed 3 iterations regardless of quality?

  ---
  Q9: Context Isolation Boundary

  You specified:
  "Each task must be executed in a standalone context"

  But the Mermaid diagram shows:
  C1: PVP generates both PVD + EP
  C2: EP generates both ED + PRP

  Question 9a: Does "task" = "generator execution" or "document generation"?

  Interpretation A (Generator = Task):
  - Context C1 executes product_vision_generator.xml
  - C1 outputs: Vision Doc + Epic Generator Prompt
  - C1 terminates
  - New Context C2 executes epic_generator.xml

  Interpretation B (Document = Task):
  - Context C1a executes product_vision_generator.xml → outputs Vision Doc only
  - Context C1b executes same generator with different instructions → outputs Epic Generator Prompt only
  - Context C2 executes Epic Generator...

  Question 9b: Should Epic Generator Prompt (produced in C1) have access to Product Vision Document (also produced in C1)?
  - If yes: How does C2 retrieve PVD? (File system read? Passed as argument?)
  - If no: How does Epic Generator know what vision to decompose?

  ---
  Q10: Master Plan Scope

  The Master Prompt (this session) must generate a Master Plan.

  Question 10a: Should the Master Plan be:

  Option A (Task List):
  # Master Plan v1.0

  ## Phase 1: Template Extraction
  - [ ] Extract PRD template from research doc → /prompts/templates/prd-template.xml
  - [ ] Extract ADR template → /prompts/templates/adr-template.xml
  [... etc ...]

  ## Phase 2: Generator Creation
  - [ ] Create product_vision_generator.xml
  - [ ] Create epic_generator.xml
  [... etc ...]

  ## Phase 3: Execution & Iteration
  - [ ] Execute PVP → Vision v1
  - [ ] Critique → Vision v2
  [... etc ...]

  Option B (Executable Workflow):
  # Master Plan v1.0

  ## Execution Sequence
  1. RUN: /kickoff execute-generator product_vision_generator
  2. WAIT_FOR_HUMAN_APPROVAL: Review /artifacts/product_vision_v1.md
  3. IF_APPROVED: RUN /kickoff execute-generator epic_generator
  4. ELSE: RUN /kickoff refine-generator product_vision_generator
  [... state machine logic ...]

  Option C (Dependency Graph):
  graph TD
    T1[Extract Templates] --> T2[Create PVP]
    T2 --> T3[Execute PVP]
    T3 --> T4{Quality Check}
    T4 -->|Pass| T5[Create EP]
    T4 -->|Fail| T6[Refine PVP]
    T6 --> T3

  Which format (or combination)?

  Question 10b: Should the Master Plan include validation criteria for each task?

  Example:
  ## Task: Execute Product Vision Generator
  **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] Vision document contains all 8 required sections
  - [ ] Problem statement includes quantified pain points
  - [ ] Success metrics are SMART-compliant
  - [ ] Epic generator prompt is syntactically valid XML

  ---
  Q11: Specialized CLAUDE.md Lifecycle

  You stated:
  "Specialized CLAUDE.md files should be created right before execution of the specialized task"

  Question 11a: Who creates specialized CLAUDE.md files?

  Scenario A (Master Prompt creates all):
  This session generates:
  - /prompts/CLAUDE-product-vision.md
  - /prompts/CLAUDE-epic.md
  - /prompts/CLAUDE-prd.md
  [... etc for all SDLC phases ...]

  Scenario B (Lazy generation):
  This session generates ONLY:
  - /CLAUDE.md (contains template for specialized CLAUDE.md)

  When execute-generator runs for first time:
  1. Checks if /prompts/CLAUDE-{task}.md exists
  2. If not, generates it from template
  3. Then proceeds with execution

  Question 11b: What information goes in specialized CLAUDE.md vs. root CLAUDE.md?

  Proposed split:
  # /CLAUDE.md (root)
  - Project overview
  - Folder structure explanation
  - How to execute generators
  - Quality standards (Flesch score, etc.)

  # /prompts/CLAUDE-product-vision.md (specialized)
  - Product Vision specific guidelines
  - Reference to vision template location
  - Example product visions from research
  - Common pitfalls for vision generation

  Approve this split, or define different boundaries?

  ---
  Dependency Mapping

  Before finalizing strategy, I need to understand execution dependencies:

  Blocker Analysis:
  Product Vision Generator Prompt depends on:
    ✓ Product Vision Template (must exist first)
    ✓ /docs/product-idea.md (initial input)
    ✓ /prompts/CLAUDE-product-vision.md (specialized context)
    ? Research document access (needed during generation?)

  Epic Generator Prompt depends on:
    ✓ Epic Template
    ✓ Product Vision Document (output from previous step)
    ✓ /prompts/CLAUDE-epic.md
    ? Product Vision Generator Prompt itself (to understand parent context?)

  Question 12: Should each generator have read access to:
  - A) Only its immediate inputs (template + prior artifact)
  - B) All upstream artifacts (Vision → Epic → PRD chain visibility)
  - C) Entire project context (all files in workspace)

  ---
  Meta-Question: Confidence Check

  Question 13: On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that:
  - My understanding of the recursive prompt architecture is correct? [Your rating: __]
  - The questions above address the critical ambiguities? [Your rating: __]
  - We're ready to generate the Strategy Document after this round? [Your rating: __]

  If any rating < 8, please explain what's still unclear.

  ---
  Proposed Next Steps (Pending Your Answers)

  Once you respond to Q6-Q13:

  1. Synthesize into Context Engineering Strategy Document v1.0
  2. Generate initial deliverables:
    - /TODO.md (master task list with dependencies from Q10)
    - /CLAUDE.md (root orchestration from Q11)
    - /docs/context_engineering_strategy.md (comprehensive workflow)
    - /.claude/commands/execute-generator.xml (universal executor from Q3)
    - /prompts/templates/ (extracted templates from Q7)
    - /prompts/product_vision_generator.xml (first generator as exemplar)
    - /docs/product-idea.md (stub for CLI tool idea)
  3. Present complete artifact set for approval
  4. Exit this context with handoff instructions for C1 execution

  Status: Paused at CLARIFY Round 2, awaiting Q6-Q13 responses.

**Human Response**:
Q6: Generator Prompt Output Format

Question 6a: Pattern B, two separate files

Question 6b: Execute-generator.xml handle file routing based on naming conventions. It should consider versioning based on refinement revisions. As we progress deeper in our recursive generator prompt execution we need to establish folder structure to avoid output file duplication. For clarification, output of product vision generator prompt is a single product vision document. Output of epic generator prompt is a set of epic documents and that requires a folder structure for sub-artifacts

---
Q7: Template Extraction Strategy

Question 7a: Option B → Converted to XML prompt format with <template> tags
Question 7b: Who extracts templates?
  Option A: Master Prompt (this session) extracts or generates, in case it is missing in the main document, all templates upfront and stores them in the repo

--- 
Q8: Iteration Refinement Mechanics

Question 8a: Which iteration trigger model for PoC?
This should be one of the main goals of this proof of concept project. The idea is in progression from Option A, to Option B how our Context Engineering workflow matures. By the end of this project we should graduate trigger mechanism to Option B (with certain human check points involving validation of the results from the previous executions, we will define some threshold for automated execution)

Question 8b: What constitutes "sufficient quality" to stop iterating?
- Human approval checkbox is the first phase

**Notes**:
- Strategy document should contain task that we need to validate and graduate Task Execution Trigger Mechanism (covered in the previous round) to a more automated options
- Strategy document should contain task that we need to validate and graduate trigger mechanism to a more automated options
- Strategy document should contain task that we need to validate and graduate sufficient quality approach to more automation

---

Q9: Context Isolation Boundary

  You specified:
  "Each task must be executed in a standalone context"

  But the Mermaid diagram shows:
  C1: PVP generates both PVD + EP
  C2: EP generates both ED + PRP

  Question 9a: "task" = "generator execution" (Interpretation A)

  Question 9b: Should Epic Generator Prompt (produced in C1) have access to Product Vision Document (also produced in C1)?
  Answer: Yes, it must have access to PVD as one of the main C2 context components. Tries file system read on predefined location if possible. Ask human to confirm the location

---
Q10: Master Plan Scope

  Question 10a: 
  Answer: Option A (Task List)
  
  Question 10b: Should the Master Plan include validation criteria for each task?
  Answer: Yes. Rationale: it will clearly present a structured report of a task execution

**Notes**:
- Task List should be enumerated (TASK-001, TASK-002...) or with more structure in the name. Rationale: Argument for fixed execution prompt can be #TASK-001 or something like that. Prompt is configured to look up the task inside predefined file (TODO.md or MasterPlan.md)
- Master Plan should be a single point of truth for all future prompt executions.

---
Q11: Specialized CLAUDE.md Lifecycle

  Question 11a: Who creates specialized CLAUDE.md files?
  Answer: Scenario B (Lazy generation)

  Question 11b: What information goes in specialized CLAUDE.md vs. root CLAUDE.md?
  Answer: proposed split approved

**Notes**:
- If specialized CLAUDE.md does not exists, it prompts human that CLAUDE-*.md needs to be generated, goes into clarification loop, and proceeds with generation only upon confirmation

Dependency Mapping

  Question 12: Should each generator have read access to:
  Answer: Option A

**Notes**:
- Let's start with smaller context for each prompt and extend it if prompt clarification loop demonstrate it as a real requirement (measured refinement as suggested by main research document)

Question 13: On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that:
Answer:
- My understanding of the recursive prompt architecture is correct? [Your rating: 9]
- The questions above address the critical ambiguities? [Your rating: 9]
- We're ready to generate the Strategy Document after this round? [Your rating: 8]

**Notes**:
- I am sure there are still some unanswered umbiguities but this is anyhow work in progress

  > Backlog user stories transform high-level user stories into comprehensive, actionable specifications. Few high-level user stories are part of PRDs and new ones can be added at any point. Each backlog user
story, as defined in our strategy and in the user story template, contains implementation tasks. Context for those implementation tasks should contain the actual user story, tech spec and ADR for the successful
 code implementation. Is that you understanding as well or it is a different one?

⏺ You've identified a critical architectural clarification that affects the entire SDLC cascade structure. Let me analyze your understanding:

  Your Understanding

  PRD (contains few high-level user stories)
    ↓
  Backlog User Stories (detailed, actionable specs)
    ↓ (context for implementation)
  Tech Spec + ADR
    ↓
  Implementation Tasks (code generation)

  Key points you're making:
  1. PRDs contain high-level user stories
  2. Backlog user stories are separate, detailed expansions of those high-level stories
  3. Backlog user stories contain implementation tasks (not just acceptance criteria)
  4. Implementation context requires: User Story + Tech Spec + ADR (not just spec alone)
  5. New backlog stories can be added anytime (not just from initial PRD decomposition)

  Current Framework Understanding (From Mermaid Diagram)

  Product Vision → Epic → PRD → User Story → (ADR + Spec + Implementation Task)

  This shows:
  - User Story comes directly after PRD
  - ADR + Spec are siblings to Implementation Task at same level

  Gap Identified

  Critical discrepancy: The current cascade doesn't distinguish between:
  - High-level user stories (in PRD)
  - Backlog user stories (detailed, implementation-ready)

  Clarification Questions

  Q1: PRD User Stories vs. Backlog User Stories

  Are these two different artifact types?

  Option A (Two distinct types):
  - PRD User Stories: High-level, conceptual (e.g., "As a user, I want authentication")
  - Backlog User Stories: Detailed, sprint-ready (e.g., "As a user, I want to upload profile picture with validation, resizing, format conversion")

  Option B (Same type, different detail level):
  - PRD contains fully detailed user stories ready for backlog
  - No separate "backlog user story" artifact needed

  My interpretation of your statement: You mean Option A

  ---
  Q2: Implementation Tasks Location

  You said: "Each backlog user story contains implementation tasks"

  Does this mean:

  Option A (Tasks embedded in User Story doc):
  # Backlog User Story: Upload Profile Picture

  ## Technical Requirements
  - Frontend task 1: Create upload component
  - Backend task 1: Create POST /upload endpoint
  - Database task 1: Add profile_image_url column

  Option B (Tasks are separate artifacts):
  /artifacts/user_stories/upload_profile_pic_v3.md
  /artifacts/implementation_tasks/upload_component_task.md
  /artifacts/implementation_tasks/upload_endpoint_task.md

  My interpretation: You mean Option A (tasks embedded in user story, per template lines 1098-1099)

  ---
  Q3: Cascade Revision

  If I understand correctly, the cascade should be:

  Product Vision
    ↓ generates
  Epic (high-level features)
    ↓ generates
  PRD (contains high-level user stories)
    ↓ generates
  Backlog User Stories (detailed, with implementation tasks)
    ↓ (used as context for)
  Tech Spec + ADR generation
    ↓ (used as context for)
  Code Implementation

  Context assembly for code generation:
  - Load: Backlog User Story + Tech Spec + ADR
  - Generate: Implementation code

  Is this correct?

  ---
  Q4: Generator Chain Impact

  Current generator chain from Mermaid diagram:
  PRP (PRD Generator) → USP (User Story Generator)

  Should this be:

  Option A (PRD generates high-level stories, separate generator creates backlog stories):
  PRD Generator → outputs PRD with high-level stories
  Backlog Story Generator → inputs PRD, outputs detailed backlog stories
  Tech Spec Generator → inputs backlog story, outputs spec

  Option B (User Story Generator creates backlog-ready stories directly):
  PRD Generator → outputs PRD (no embedded stories)
  User Story Generator → inputs PRD, outputs backlog-ready stories
  Tech Spec Generator → inputs user story, outputs spec

  Which option aligns with your vision?

  ---
  Q5: Template Validation

  Looking at current /prompts/templates/user-story-template.xml:

  Lines 1098-1099:
  ## Technical Requirements
  - [Frontend task 1]
  - [Backend task 1]

  This suggests tasks ARE embedded in user story (supporting your understanding).

  But looking at PRD template (lines 676-680):
  ### Functional Requirements
  | ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |

  Question: Are these functional requirements the "high-level user stories" you mentioned, or something different?

  ---
  Proposed Revision (Based on Your Understanding)

  Updated Cascade

  C1: product_vision_generator
      ↓ outputs
  Product Vision + epic_generator

  C2: epic_generator
      ↓ outputs
  Epics + prd_generator

  C3: prd_generator
      ↓ outputs
  PRD (with high-level stories/requirements) + backlog_story_generator

  C4: backlog_story_generator
      ↓ outputs
  Detailed Backlog User Stories (with embedded implementation tasks) + tech_spec_generator

  C5: tech_spec_generator + adr_generator
      ↓ outputs
  Tech Specs + ADRs + code_generator

  C6: code_generator
      ↓ context: Backlog User Story + Tech Spec + ADR
      ↓ outputs
  Implementation Code + test_generator

  Key change: Added backlog_story_generator as separate phase between PRD and Tech Spec.

  ---
  Action Required

  Please confirm or correct:

  1. Are PRD stories and Backlog stories different artifacts? (Yes/No + explanation)
  2. Are implementation tasks embedded in user story docs? (Yes/No)
  3. Does code generation context need User Story + Tech Spec + ADR? (Yes/No)
  4. Should I revise the cascade in strategy document and Mermaid diagram? (Yes/No)
  5. Should I create a separate backlog-story-template.xml or rename user-story-template.xml?

  Once you confirm, I'll update:
  - /docs/context_engineering_strategy_v1.md (Section 2.3 Cascade Execution)
  - /TODO.md (add TASK-0XX for backlog story generation if needed)
  - Mermaid diagram in your original Q1 response
  - Generator prompt chain logic

  This is an excellent catch that ensures the framework matches real-world SDLC practices. 🎯


**Human Response**:
Q1: PRD User Stories vs. Backlog User Stories

Answer: Option A

**Rationale**:
- High-level user story is more orientied towards audience of product owners and stakeholders, which are focused on more details. Backlog user story is critical and detailed input data for ADRs, Tech Spec creation, and final Implementation Tasks definition. Software engineer and/or coding AI agent must have access to backlog user story, related ADRs, tech spec and implementation task content. This content together gives enough information to implementation team to understand scope, audience, success metrics, acceptance criteria, and the clear goal. It states the *who*, *what*, *why*, and *how* explicitly.

---
Q2: Implementation Tasks Location

Answer: Option A + checkbox

**Rationale**:
- Each backlog user story needs to be a live system. It lists the implementation tasks, but it needs to track their status as well. We can start by having simple checkbox (TODO list kind)
- Second phase is to store each backlog user story and task to a proper backlog tracking system (e.g. JIRA)
- **IMPORTANT** Second phase should be part of graduation cycle of Master Plan

---
Q3: Cascade Revision

Answer: yes, you understood correctly. Context assembly for code generation:
  - Input: Backlog User Story + Tech Spec + ADR
  - Goal: Implementation Task definition/title
  - Generate: Implementation code

---
Q4: Generator Chain Impact

Answer: Option A (PRD generates high-level stories, separate generator creates backlog stories)

**Notes**:
- Each high-level user story within PRD needs to be tracked. We can start with simple checkbox, which gives us a status of `Processed`, meaning the user story was given to the Backlog User Story Generator and it was distilled to backlog user stories for further processing.
- Each backlog user stories has its own subfolder with artifacts

**Rationale**:
- Backlog User Story Generator gets high-level user story and generates detailed backlog story. This gives us the option to just use Backlog User Story Generator for adding new simple high-level stories without a need to always create PRD (software enhancements, bug fixes, minor updates)

---
Q5: Template Validation

Answer: both sections are `Functional Requirements`. Please update `user-story-template.xml` for clarity. We also need section for non-functional requirements in both documents, if missing.

**Notes**:
- `/prompts/templates/user-story-template.xml` is backlog user story template
- `Functional Requirements` within PRD reflect on the requirements for all high-level user stories in general, like an overview

**Rationale**:
- Implementation team requires functional and non-functional requirements for proper code generation. The team only has access to backlog user story, ADR, Tech Spec and implementation task (as a final task goal). If baclog user story is missing non-functional requirements we will reach a context gap during implementation.

---
Proposed Revision needs corrections:
- C6 is currently out of the scope. We will handle that section separately. Focus of this context is document generation realm.
- C5 should output Tech Specs + ADRs, without code_generator
