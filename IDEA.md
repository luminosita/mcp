- Problem overview
    - Our current AI-assistance framework for software product documentation and implementation relies on AI agent artifacts (commands, prompts and templates) as local files residing in the same repository as software artifacts
    - By using our AI-assistance framework for creation of new products we are forced to keep local version of AI agent artifacts per product repository. Huge maintenance problem.
    - We want a single repository for all AI agent artifacts with proper versioning and documentation
- Target users (high-level)
    - Product managers creating software product documentation utilizing assistance of AI agents
    - Software engineers creating software artifacts utilizing assistance of AI agents
- Key capabilities (draft)
    - AI Agent should access commands, prompts and templates as MCP Server resources and prompts
    - AI Agent should prime AI context with RAG queries accessable as MCP Server tool
- Initial constraints
    - Inital scope is to encapsulate all AI agent artifacts within MCP Server
