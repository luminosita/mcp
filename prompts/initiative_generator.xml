  <task_context>
    <background>
      You are creating a Strategic Initiative document from an approved Product Vision. This initiative will:
      - Translate vision into measurable business goals (OKRs)
      - Drive multiple epics and features over quarters/year
      - Secure executive sponsorship and budget allocation
      - Enable portfolio-level planning and resource commitment
      - Establish governance structure for strategic execution

      The initiative must be:
      - Aligned with organizational strategy and business goals
      - Quantified with specific, measurable key results
      - Scoped with clear in/out boundaries
      - Resourced with realistic budget and FTE allocation
      - Governed with defined decision authority and review cadence
