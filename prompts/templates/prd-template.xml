[2-3 paragraph overview: problem, solution, impact]

## Epic Context

**Parent Epic:** [EPIC-XXX: Epic Title]
- **Link:** {SDLC_DOCUMENTS_URL}/epic/{id} (example: {SDLC_DOCUMENTS_URL}/epic/006)

**Business Value (from Epic §1):**
[1-2 sentence summary referencing Epic §1. Business Value - full details in parent Epic]

- [Metric from Epic §3]: [How this PRD contributes]

**Note:** For comprehensive business context (market analysis, competitive landscape, user research), see parent Epic-XXX sections §1-§4 and Business Research document.

## Goals & Success Metrics

**PRD-Specific Goals** (refined from Epic §3):

| Goal | Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| [Goal 1] | [Metric] | [Target] | [How measured] |

**Note:** These metrics are PRD-specific refinements. See Epic-XXX §3. Success Metrics for epic-level targets.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| FR-01 | [Requirement] | Must-have | [Criteria] |

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** [specific targets]
- **Security:** [requirements]
- **Scalability:** [targets]
- **Accessibility:** [WCAG standards]

## User Experience
### User Flows
[Mermaid diagrams or step-by-step flows]

### Wireframes/Mockups
[Link to designs]

## Technical Considerations

**DECISION HIERARCHY:** CLAUDE.md (Authoritative) > Implementation Research (Advisory) > PRD-specific (Supplementary)

**Note:** PRD generator enforces this hierarchy. CLAUDE.md decisions referenced by file+line, alternatives NOT suggested for decided topics.

### Alignment with CLAUDE.md Standards

**Established Decisions Applied:**
- **CLAUDE-core.md:** [Core development philosophy]
- **CLAUDE-architecture.md:** [Project structure, modularity patterns]
- **CLAUDE-tooling.md:** [Build tools, linters, formatters - e.g., "UV for Python, Ruff for linting"]
- **CLAUDE-testing.md:** [Testing framework - e.g., "pytest with fixtures, 80% coverage"]
- **CLAUDE-http-frameworks.md (Go):** [HTTP framework - e.g., "Gin per line 238"]
- [Additional CLAUDE-*.md files as applicable]

**Example (Compliant):**
```
Use Gin HTTP framework per CLAUDE-http-frameworks.md:238 (Gin = default for Go REST APIs)
```

**Example (Non-Compliant - DON'T DO THIS):**
```
❌ "Use chi, gin, or gorilla/mux" (suggests alternatives when Gin already decided)
```

### Implementation Research (Gaps Only)

**Applied Insights (ONLY for topics not in CLAUDE.md):**
- **§[X.Y]: [Pattern Name]:** [Technical guidance]
  - **CLAUDE.md Status:** `[CLAUDE.md GAP]` or `[ALIGNS WITH CLAUDE-{file}.md]`

**Example:**
```
§5.3 Cache invalidation strategy - [CLAUDE-caching.md GAP]
Recommendation: Time-based TTL with 5-minute expiration
```

### CLAUDE.md Override (When Justified)

**If override needed, document:**
```
[CLAUDE.md OVERRIDE] {Alternative approach}
- Original: CLAUDE-{file}.md:{line} "{decision}"
- Rationale: {Technical justification}
- Approval: [APPROVED BY: {name} - {date}]
```

### Architecture
[High-level architecture approach - product-specific only, supplement CLAUDE.md]

### Dependencies
**System:** [Systems, services, databases]
**External:** [Third-party integrations]

### Technical Constraints
[Limitations, platform requirements]

### Data Model
[Key entities, relationships]

## Risks & Mitigations

**PRD-Specific Risks** (technical, delivery, implementation):

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| [Technical/Delivery Risk 1] | High | Medium | [Strategy] |

**Note:** Business and market risks are documented in Epic-XXX §4. Business Risks & Mitigations. This section focuses on PRD-specific technical and delivery risks.

## Timeline & Milestones
- Phase 1: [dates] - [deliverables]
- Phase 2: [dates] - [deliverables]

## Decisions Made

**Note:** This section added in v2+ after feedback provided. Answered questions from Open Questions move here.

**Q1: [Question]**
- **Decision:** [Answer]
- **Rationale:** [Why this decision was made]
- **Decided By:** [Person/Role] ([Date])

## Open Questions

**PRD is a BRIDGE ARTIFACT: Include both business and strategic technical questions, but defer implementation details to later phases.**

**✅ INCLUDE in PRD Open Questions:**

1. **Business Questions (from Epic or new):**
   - Market priorities and user segment questions
   - Business model and pricing questions
   - Regulatory/compliance uncertainties
   - Strategic timing and resource allocation

2. **Product/Technical Trade-offs (PM + Tech Lead discussion):**
   - Questions balancing user experience with technical constraints
   - Build vs. buy decisions affecting timeline and features
   - Architecture approach questions affecting product decisions
   - Technical feasibility questions impacting requirements or scope

**❌ DEFER to ADR/Tech Spec phases:**
- Specific implementation details (algorithms, data structures, patterns)
- Granular technology choices (library selection, specific tools)
- Low-level architecture decisions not affecting product requirements
- Questions answerable during implementation without stakeholder input

---

**Examples of PRD-APPROPRIATE questions:**

[BUSINESS] "Should we prioritize enterprise customers or SMB users in the initial release?"

[TECHNICAL] "Should we prioritize offline-first capability or real-time sync in V1?" (affects user experience and architecture)

[TECHNICAL] "What authentication approach balances user experience with security requirements?" (affects NFRs and user flows)

[TECHNICAL] "Should we build notification infrastructure or integrate with third-party service?" (build vs. buy decision)

---

**Examples of questions to DEFER (for ADR/Tech Spec):**

- "Should we use Redis or Memcached for caching?" (specific technology choice - ADR)
- "What specific encryption algorithm for data at rest?" (implementation detail - Tech Spec)
- "Should we use repository or active record pattern?" (low-level design - Tech Spec)

---

**MANDATORY MARKER USAGE (Hard Enforcement):**

**Version 1 Artifacts:**
- Open Questions should include **Recommendations** for each question (exploratory, not yet decided)
- Include alternatives, context, decision criteria
- No markers required in v1 (questions are exploratory)

**After Feedback (Version 2+):**
- Answered questions MUST move to **"Decisions Made"** section
- Remaining unresolved questions MUST use standardized markers:
  - [REQUIRES PM + TECH LEAD] (product/technical trade-offs)
  - [REQUIRES EXECUTIVE DECISION] (business-level decisions from Epic)
  - [REQUIRES ORGANIZATIONAL ALIGNMENT] (if cross-functional alignment needed)

**Required Sub-fields for Each Marker:**

[REQUIRES PM + TECH LEAD]
- **Trade-off:** {Product vs. technical tension}
- **PM Perspective:** {User experience, business value considerations}
- **Tech Perspective:** {Implementation complexity, technical debt considerations}
- **Decision Needed By:** {Date}

[REQUIRES EXECUTIVE DECISION]
- **Decision Needed:** {What needs executive approval}
- **Options Considered:** {List alternatives}
- **Business Impact:** {Revenue, risk, resource implications}
- **Decision Deadline:** {Date by which decision needed}

[REQUIRES ORGANIZATIONAL ALIGNMENT]
- **Stakeholders:** {List departments/teams requiring alignment}
- **Alignment Topic:** {What needs consensus}
- **Impact Without Alignment:** {Risk of proceeding without consensus}
- **Decision Deadline:** {Date}

**PROHIBITED:**
- ❌ Free-form text: "Decision: PM and Tech Lead need to discuss"
- ❌ Generic actions: "Action Required: Schedule PM/Tech Lead meeting..."
- ✅ Use standardized markers with required sub-fields instead

**Exception - Meta-instruction Only:**
"Action Required:" text may be used ONLY for strong emphasis when markers are missing:
```
⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED:** This artifact has 3 open questions without markers.
Add [REQUIRES PM + TECH LEAD] or [REQUIRES EXECUTIVE DECISION] markers before finalization. ⚠️
```
(This is a meta-instruction about the artifact itself, not the actual question documentation)

---

**If no open questions exist, state:** "No open questions at this time. Technical implementation details will be addressed in ADR and Technical Specification phases."

---

- [Question 1 with marker if v2+]
- [Question 2 with marker if v2+]
