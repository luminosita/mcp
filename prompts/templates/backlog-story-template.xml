# User Story: [Backlog User Story Title]

## Metadata
- **Story ID:** US-[XXX]
- **Title:** [Enhanced ticket title]
- **Type:** Feature
- **Status:** [Backlog/Ready/In Progress/In Review/Done]
- **Priority:** [High/Medium/Low with brief justification]

## User Story
As [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit].

## Description
[Expanded problem statement or feature description with context and background]

## Parent PRD Details
**Parent PRD:** PRD-[XXX]
**Parent PRD Link:** [URL to PRD document v3]
**Parent High-Level Story:** [HLS-XX reference from PRD or standalone]
**Functional Requirements Covered:** [FR-01, FR-03, ...]
**Informed By Implementation Research:** [Link to Implementation Research document]

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** [Link to Implementation Research report]

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§[X.Y]: [Pattern Name]:** [How this pattern applies to implementation]
  - **Example Code:** [Reference to research code example if applicable]
- **§[X.Y]: [Security Pattern]:** [Security implementation guidance]
- **§[X.Y]: [Testing Strategy]:** [Testing approach from research]

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **§[X.Y]: [Pitfall Name]:** [How we're avoiding this pitfall]

**Performance Considerations:**
- **§[X.Y]: [Performance Pattern]:** [Target metrics and approach]

## Functional Requirements
- [User-facing feature 1]
- [User-facing feature 2]
- [Business logic requirement 1]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** [Response time, throughput targets - e.g., P95 < 200ms]
- **Security:** [Auth, encryption, input validation requirements]
- **Scalability:** [Concurrent user targets - e.g., 1000 concurrent users]
- **Reliability:** [Uptime target, error handling - e.g., 99.9% uptime]
- **Accessibility:** [WCAG compliance level - e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level AA]
- **Maintainability:** [Code quality, documentation standards]

## Technical Requirements
- [Frontend task 1]
- [Backend task 1]
- [Database change 1]
- [Additional technical considerations]

## Acceptance Criteria

**Format Guidance:**
- **Preferred:** Gherkin format (Given-When-Then) for scenario-based validation
- **Fallback:** Checklist format for simpler validations or non-scenario-based criteria
- Reference: SDLC Artifacts Guideline v1.1, Section 3.1.3

### Gherkin Format Example:
### Scenario 1: [Scenario name]
**Given** [initial context]
**When** [action taken]
**Then** [expected outcome]

### Scenario 2: [Scenario name]
**Given** [initial context]
**When** [action taken]
**Then** [expected outcome]

### Checklist Format Example (Alternative):
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion 2]
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion 3]

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (80% coverage minimum)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Acceptance criteria validated
- [ ] Product owner approval obtained

## Additional Information
**Suggested Labels:** [List of labels, e.g., frontend, backend, user-profile]
**Estimated Story Points:** [Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
**Dependencies:** [References to other stories or technical requirements]
**Related PRD Section:** [Link to PRD section]

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**Backlog Story Open Questions capture IMPLEMENTATION uncertainties needing resolution during sprint.**

**Question Types:**
- [REQUIRES SPIKE] - Time-boxed investigation needed
- [REQUIRES ADR] - Significant technical decision (may need alternatives analysis)
- [REQUIRES TECH LEAD] - Senior technical input needed
- [BLOCKED BY] - External dependency

---

**Examples of appropriate questions:**
- "Should we use Joi or Yup for request validation?" [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- "What's optimal database index strategy?" [REQUIRES SPIKE]
- "Does caching improve performance enough to justify complexity?" [REQUIRES SPIKE]
- "How to handle race conditions for concurrent updates?" [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]

**Examples of questions for other phases:**
- ❌ "Should settings be in profile or dedicated page?" (High-Level Story - UX)
- ❌ "Should we use Redis or PostgreSQL?" (ADR - major decision)

---

**If no open questions exist, state:** "No open implementation questions. All technical approaches clear from Implementation Research and PRD."

---

- [Implementation Question 1 with marker]
- [Implementation Question 2 with marker]

**Note:** Questions marked [REQUIRES ADR] should trigger ADR creation before implementation begins.

## Traceability Validation Checklist

**Upstream Traceability:**
- [ ] "Parent PRD" field populated with valid PRD ID (PRD-XXX)
- [ ] "Parent High-Level Story" field populated (HLS-XX or standalone)
- [ ] "Functional Requirements Covered" lists all FR-XX from PRD
- [ ] "Informed By Implementation Research" field populated with valid document link
- [ ] Parent PRD document is in "Approved" status
- [ ] Implementation Research document is in "Finalized" status
- [ ] All Implementation Research section references (§X.Y format) are valid
- [ ] Technical patterns from research are applied appropriately

**Consistency Checks:**
- [ ] Status value follows standardized format: Backlog/Ready/In Progress/In Review/Done
- [ ] Story ID follows standard format: US-XXX
- [ ] All placeholder fields [brackets] have been filled in
- [ ] User story follows format: "As [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable (Given-When-Then format preferred)
- [ ] Story points estimated and sprint assigned

    <example source="Section 6.4 lines 1075-1077, enhanced with format guidance">
      **User Story:**
      As registered user, I want to be able to upload profile picture so that I can personalize my account.

      **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format - Preferred):**

      Scenario 1: Successful profile picture upload
      Given I am logged in
      When I navigate to profile settings
      Then I see an upload button for profile picture

      Scenario 2: Upload and display profile picture
      Given I have selected a valid image file
      When I click the upload button
      Then the image is saved to my profile
      And the new profile picture is displayed immediately

      **Acceptance Criteria (Checklist Format - Alternative):**
      - [ ] Upload button visible on profile settings page for logged-in users
      - [ ] Clicking upload button opens file selection dialog
      - [ ] Valid image file (JPG, PNG) can be selected and uploaded
      - [ ] Uploaded image is saved to user profile
      - [ ] Profile picture displays immediately after successful upload
      - [ ] Error message shown for invalid file types
