### External Dependencies
- [Third-party service dependency]
- [Data availability dependency]

## Non-Functional Requirements (User-Facing Only)

**Note:** Technical NFRs (performance targets, architecture) belong in PRD or Backlog Stories. Only user-facing NFRs here.

- **Usability:** [User experience requirements]
- **Accessibility:** [WCAG level, screen reader support]
- **Localization:** [Languages supported]
- **Compliance:** [User-facing compliance needs, e.g., "User must consent to data collection"]

## Risks & Open Questions

### Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| [User adoption risk] | High/Med/Low | [Strategy] |
| [Usability risk] | High/Med/Low | [Strategy] |

### Open Questions

**High-Level Story Open Questions focus on USER/UX/FUNCTIONAL uncertainties needing validation before backlog refinement.**

**✅ INCLUDE - User/UX/Functional Questions:**
- User behavior or preference uncertainties (requires user research/validation)
- UX design questions (requires design input or usability testing)
- Functional requirement clarifications from stakeholders
- Scope or priority questions (requires product owner decision)
- User workflow ambiguities

**❌ EXCLUDE - Other Phase Questions:**
- Business questions (market, business model) → Epic/PRD
- Product/technical trade-offs → PRD
- Implementation uncertainties → Backlog Story
- Technical decisions → ADR/Tech Spec

---

**Examples of appropriate questions:**
- "Do users prefer category toggles or dropdown for notification preferences?" [REQUIRES UX DESIGN]
- "Should notification settings be in profile or dedicated settings page?" [REQUIRES UX RESEARCH]
- "What is the priority order for notification categories?" [REQUIRES PRODUCT OWNER]
- "Do we need bulk enable/disable all option?" [REQUIRES PRODUCT OWNER]

**Examples of questions for other phases:**
- ❌ "Should we prioritize enterprise or SMB users?" (Epic/PRD)
- ❌ "What API endpoint structure?" (Backlog Story)
- ❌ "Should we use Redis or PostgreSQL?" (ADR)

---

**If no open questions exist, state:** "No open UX or functional questions at this time. Implementation uncertainties will be captured during backlog refinement."

---

- [User/UX Question 1 - mark as [REQUIRES UX RESEARCH/DESIGN] or [REQUIRES PRODUCT OWNER]]
- [Functional Question 2]

      # High-Level User Story: Configure Push Notification Preferences

      ## User Story Statement
      **As a** mobile app user,
      **I want** to configure which types of push notifications I receive,
      **So that** I only get notifications relevant to my interests and avoid notification fatigue.

      ## User Context

      ### Target Persona
      Active mobile app user who receives multiple notifications daily

      **User Characteristics:**
      - Uses app 3-5 times per week
      - Frustrated by irrelevant notifications
      - Values control over their notification experience

      ## Business Value

      ### User Value
      - Reduces notification fatigue
      - Improves app experience by showing only relevant content
      - Gives users control over their interaction with the app

      ### Business Value
      - Reduces app uninstalls due to notification annoyance (target: -20%)
      - Increases engagement with notifications (target: +35% open rate)
      - Improves user satisfaction scores

      ## Functional Requirements (High-Level)

      ### Primary User Flow

      **Happy Path:**
      1. User navigates to notification settings
      2. User views available notification categories
      3. User enables/disables categories
      4. User saves preferences
      5. System confirms changes applied

      ## Acceptance Criteria

      ### Criterion 1: User can view notification categories
      **Given** user is in notification settings
      **When** user views the settings screen
      **Then** user sees all available notification categories (marketing, transactional, alerts)

      ### Criterion 2: User can toggle categories
      **Given** user sees notification categories
      **When** user toggles a category on/off
      **Then** system immediately updates the preference

      ### Criterion 3: Changes persist
      **Given** user has changed notification preferences
      **When** user closes and reopens the app
      **Then** preferences remain as configured

      ## Decomposition into Backlog Stories

      1. **Display notification preferences screen** (~3 SP)
         - Brief: Create UI to show all notification categories

      2. **Implement preference toggle logic** (~5 SP)
         - Brief: Backend API to save/retrieve user preferences

      3. **Apply preferences to notification delivery** (~5 SP)
         - Brief: Filter notifications based on user preferences

      **Total Estimated Story Points:** ~13 SP
      **Estimated Sprints:** 2 sprints
