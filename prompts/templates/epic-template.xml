      # Epic: User Authentication System

      As a CLI tool user, I need secure authentication so that my data remains private and only I can access my account.

      Business Value:
      - User Impact: Users can trust the tool with sensitive data
      - Business Impact: Reduces support tickets by 40% (no password reset requests initially)

      High-Level Stories:
      1. As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can use the tool
      2. As a returning user, I want to log in securely so that I can access my data
      3. As a security-conscious user, I want 2FA so that my account is extra secure
