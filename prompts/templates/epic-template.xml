## Open Questions

**IMPORTANT: Include ONLY business-level questions. Technical questions and product/technical trade-offs belong in PRD phase.**

**Epic Open Questions focus on:**
- Market priorities and user segments
- Business model and pricing
- Regulatory/compliance requirements
- Strategic timing and resource allocation

**EXCLUDE from Epic (defer to PRD phase):**
- Technical questions (architecture, implementation, technology choices)
- Product/technical trade-offs (requiring PM + Tech Lead collaboration)

---

✅ **Examples of ACCEPTABLE questions (business-only):**
- "Should we prioritize enterprise or SMB customers in the initial release?"
- "Are there data privacy regulations specific to our target markets?"
- "What is the acceptable customer acquisition cost for this feature?"
- "Should we target mobile or desktop users first?"

❌ **Examples of UNACCEPTABLE questions - Technical (defer to PRD/Tech Spec/ADR):**
- "Should we use OAuth2 or SAML for authentication?"
- "What database should we use for storage?"
- "Should the API be REST or GraphQL?"
- "Which cloud provider should host this?"

❌ **Examples of UNACCEPTABLE questions - Product/Technical Trade-offs (defer to PRD - PM + Tech Lead):**
- "Should we prioritize offline-first capability or real-time sync in V1?"
- "What authentication approach balances user experience with security requirements?"
- "Should we build or integrate with third-party service for notifications?"

---

**If no business questions exist, state:** "No open business questions at this time. Technical decisions and product/technical trade-offs will be addressed in PRD phase."

      # Epic: User Authentication System

      As a CLI tool user, I need secure authentication so that my data remains private and only I can access my account.

      Business Value:
      - User Impact: Users can trust the tool with sensitive data
      - Business Impact: Reduces support tickets by 40% (no password reset requests initially)

      High-Level Stories:
      1. As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can use the tool
      2. As a returning user, I want to log in securely so that I can access my data
      3. As a security-conscious user, I want 2FA so that my account is extra secure
