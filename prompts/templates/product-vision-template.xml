- [Constraint 2]

### Assumptions
- [Assumption 1: e.g., user behavior, market conditions]
- [Assumption 2]

### Strategic Uncertainties
**Vision-level strategic uncertainties requiring validation or stakeholder alignment.**

**Note:** Product Vision is typically created after thorough Business Research. If significant uncertainties remain, consider whether Business Research needs additional validation or whether these questions belong in Initiative/Epic phases.

**Appropriate for Vision-level (if needed):**
- Market validation questions requiring further research
- Strategic positioning questions requiring executive alignment
- Organizational readiness questions

**Examples:**
- "Is there sufficient market demand to justify 2-year investment?" [REQUIRES MARKET VALIDATION]
- "Does this vision align with company's 5-year strategic plan?" [REQUIRES EXECUTIVE ALIGNMENT]
- "Is there organizational appetite for this level of innovation?" [REQUIRES LEADERSHIP INPUT]

**If no strategic uncertainties, state:** "No strategic uncertainties. Vision is grounded in comprehensive Business Research and validated with stakeholders."

- [Strategic uncertainty 1 with marker - if applicable]
- [Strategic uncertainty 2 with marker - if applicable]
