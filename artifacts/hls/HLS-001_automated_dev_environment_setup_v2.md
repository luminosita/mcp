## User Story Statement

**As a** developer joining the project,
**I want** to set up my complete development environment through a single automated script,
**So that** I can begin contributing to the codebase within 30 minutes without manual configuration or troubleshooting.

## User Context

### Target Persona

**Primary Persona:** Senior Backend Engineer (5-10 years experience)
- Comfortable with Python, container runtimes, Kubernetes
- Has worked with modern DevOps practices and infrastructure-as-code
- Values efficiency and well-documented infrastructure patterns
- Expects minimal friction environment setup enabling immediate productivity

**Secondary Persona:** New Team Member / Mid-Level Engineer (2-4 years experience)
- Solid Python fundamentals but less familiar with advanced async patterns
- Requires clear documentation and troubleshooting guidance
- Needs step-by-step setup instructions with examples
- Benefits from quick feedback loops through automated validation

**User Characteristics:**
- Needs to clone repository and begin productive work within first day
- Frustrated by "works on my machine" failures and manual configuration steps
- Values isolation between projects to avoid dependency conflicts
- Expects modern development tooling (fast package managers, hot-reload)

### User Journey Context

This story represents the **critical first interaction** with the project infrastructure. Success here determines whether developers can quickly begin contributing or face multi-day setup frustrations.

**Journey Position:**
1. **Before:** Developer receives repository access and project onboarding materials
2. **This Story:** Developer sets up local development environment
3. **After:** Developer implements first feature using established application patterns (future story)

Per Business Research ยง1.1 Pain Point 1, environment inconsistency creates "works on my machine" failures that waste hours of debugging time. This story directly addresses that pain point by establishing isolated, reproducible environments.

## Business Value

### User Value

Developers receive **immediate productivity** through automated environment setup that eliminates manual configuration overhead. Instead of spending hours or days debugging environment issues, developers achieve working environments in under 30 minutes and can begin contributing meaningful work on their first day.

Key user benefits:
- **Time Savings:** Reduces setup time from 4 hours to 2 days (current state) to <30 minutes
- **Reduced Frustration:** Eliminates "works on my machine" failures through isolated environments
- **Confidence:** Clear documentation with troubleshooting guidance reduces setup anxiety
- **Consistency:** All developers work in identical environments regardless of host OS

### Business Value

Accelerates **time-to-first-contribution** for new team members, enabling rapid team scaling without linear training overhead. Standardized environments reduce integration defects and support handoffs between team members.

Quantifiable business impact (per PRD-000 Section 4.1):
- **Onboarding Velocity:** Reduces time from access grant to first merged PR from 3-5 days to <2 days (60% improvement)
- **Team Scaling:** Enables addition of new team members without dedicated mentoring for environment setup
- **Quality Improvement:** Consistent environments reduce environment-related bugs by eliminating configuration drift

Per Business Research ยง5.1, establishing production-ready patterns positions the project as reference architecture for enterprise MCP deployments. Strong foundation enables subsequent feature development without infrastructure debt.

### Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Setup time from clone to working environment | <30 minutes | Automated timing in setup script; developer surveys during onboarding |
| Setup success rate on supported platforms | >98% | Tracking setup script exit codes across macOS, Linux, WSL2 |
| Time to first merged PR | <2 days | Time tracking from repository access to first meaningful contribution |
| Developer satisfaction with setup process | >4.5/5 | Post-onboarding survey question: "Rate ease of environment setup" |

## Functional Requirements (High-Level)

### Primary User Flow

**Happy Path:**

1. Developer receives repository access and onboarding documentation
2. Developer reviews README.md containing quick start instructions
3. Developer clones repository from version control to local machine
4. Developer ensures Devbox is preinstalled (via system-setup from dotfiles repository)
5. Developer enters Devbox isolated shell: `devbox shell`
6. Developer runs automated setup script: `scripts/setup.nu`
7. Setup script offers interactive prompts for configuration options (with sensible defaults for silent mode)
8. Setup script executes within Devbox environment with verbose output and progress indicators:
   - Detects operating system (macOS/Linux/WSL2)
   - Checks prerequisites (Python 3.11+, Podman, Git)
   - Installs uv package manager if not present
   - Creates virtual environment (`.venv/`)
   - Installs all dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
   - Configures pre-commit hooks for code quality
   - Copies `.env.example` to `.env` with default values
   - Validates environment health through automated checks
   - Outputs success message with clear next steps
9. Developer starts development server: `uv run uvicorn main:app --reload`
10. Developer verifies setup by accessing health check endpoint (http://localhost:8000/health)
11. Developer receives confirmation: `{"status": "healthy", "version": "0.1.0"}`
12. Developer reviews contributing documentation to understand development workflow
13. Developer opens VS Code with configured extensions (if IDE setup selected during prompts)
14. Developer begins feature implementation with confidence

**Total Time:** <30 minutes (Success criterion)

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Alt Flow 1 (Missing Prerequisites):** If Python 3.11+, Podman, or Git not installed within Devbox, setup script provides clear error message directing user to install missing prerequisites or check `devbox.json` configuration
- **Alt Flow 2 (Network Issues):** If dependency download fails due to network issues, setup script retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff before failing with actionable error message
- **Alt Flow 3 (Permission Issues):** If file system permissions prevent virtual environment creation, setup script detects issue and provides resolution steps (check directory permissions, verify disk space)
- **Alt Flow 4 (Silent Mode):** If developer runs setup with `--silent` flag, all prompts use sensible defaults without user interaction (enables CI/automation scenarios)

### User Interactions

From user perspective (NOT implementation details):

- **Clone repository:** Developer uses Git to obtain project source code
- **Enter isolated environment:** Developer activates Devbox shell for reproducible environment
- **Run setup script:** Developer executes single command to automate all configuration
- **Respond to prompts:** Developer answers interactive questions about configuration preferences (or accepts defaults)
- **Review progress indicators:** Developer sees clear verbose progress messages with progress bars as setup executes each step
- **Start development server:** Developer runs simple command to launch application locally
- **Verify functionality:** Developer accesses health check endpoint to confirm successful setup
- **Open IDE:** Developer launches VS Code with pre-configured extensions
- **Review documentation:** Developer reads contributing guide to understand next steps

### System Behaviors (User Perspective)

What the system does from user's point of view (NO technical details):

- **Validates prerequisites:** System checks that required tools are available before proceeding
- **Prompts for preferences:** System asks about configuration options with sensible defaults provided
- **Installs dependencies:** System automatically downloads and installs all required packages
- **Configures environment:** System sets up development environment with appropriate settings
- **Configures IDE:** System sets up VS Code with standard extensions (if selected)
- **Provides feedback:** System displays verbose progress messages with progress indicators showing completion percentage
- **Enables immediate work:** System ensures all components are ready for feature development
- **Offers troubleshooting:** System provides clear error messages with resolution guidance when issues occur

## Acceptance Criteria (High-Level)

### Criterion 1: Rapid Setup Completion

**Given** a developer with a supported OS (macOS, Linux, or Windows WSL2) and Devbox preinstalled
**When** they clone the repository and run the setup script within Devbox shell
**Then** they achieve a working development environment in under 30 minutes without manual troubleshooting

### Criterion 2: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**Given** developers using different operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows WSL2)
**When** they run the same setup script within their respective Devbox environments
**Then** all developers achieve identical working environments with the same dependencies and configurations

### Criterion 3: Clear Verbose Progress Feedback

**Given** a developer running the setup script
**When** the script executes each configuration step
**Then** the developer sees verbose output showing detailed step information AND progress indicators (e.g., progress bars, percentage complete) showing overall setup progress

### Criterion 4: Interactive Configuration with Sensible Defaults

**Given** a developer running the setup script in interactive mode
**When** the script prompts for configuration options
**Then** the developer can customize settings via prompts OR accept sensible defaults for quick setup

### Criterion 5: Silent Mode for Automation

**Given** a developer or CI system running setup with `--silent` flag
**When** the script executes
**Then** all configuration prompts use sensible defaults without requiring user interaction, enabling automated setup scenarios

### Criterion 6: Validation and Verification

**Given** the setup script has completed successfully
**When** the developer starts the development server and accesses the health check endpoint
**Then** the server responds with a healthy status confirming all components are working correctly

### Criterion 7: Effective Error Handling

**Given** a developer encounters a setup error (missing prerequisite, network failure, permission issue)
**When** the setup script fails
**Then** the developer receives a clear error message with specific troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue

### Edge Cases & Error Conditions

- **Missing Prerequisites:** Setup script detects missing tools (Python, Podman, Git) and provides installation instructions with links to official documentation
- **Network Unavailable:** Setup script handles network failures gracefully with retry logic and offline fallback guidance
- **Disk Space Insufficient:** Setup script checks available disk space before dependency installation and warns user if space is low
- **Unsupported OS:** Setup script detects unsupported operating systems and provides clear message about supported platforms (macOS, Linux, WSL2)

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope

- Automated setup script supporting macOS, Linux, and Windows WSL2
- Isolated development environment using Devbox for reproducibility
- Standardized repository directory structure (Python src layout)
- Automated dependency installation via uv package manager
- Virtual environment configuration
- Pre-commit hooks setup for code quality
- Environment variable configuration from template
- Health check validation

- Support for IDEs other than VS Code - VS Code standardized per Decision D1
- Database setup and migration - handled in separate story focused on data persistence
- CI/CD pipeline configuration - covered by separate story (HLS-002)
- Application feature implementation - covered by subsequent feature stories
- Custom tool development - covered by tool-specific stories

## Decomposition into Backlog Stories

### Estimated Backlog Stories (Not Yet Detailed)

1. **Create Automated Setup Script (NuShell) with Interactive Prompts** (~6 SP)
   - Brief: Implement cross-platform setup script using NuShell that detects OS, validates prerequisites, offers interactive prompts with sensible defaults, supports silent mode, installs dependencies, and configures development environment within Devbox with verbose output and progress indicators

2. **Establish Repository Directory Structure** (~2 SP)
   - Brief: Create standardized directory structure following Python src layout with appropriate subdirectories for code, tests, documentation, and configuration

3. **Configure Devbox Isolated Environment** (~3 SP)
   - Brief: Create `devbox.json` configuration defining isolated development environment with Python 3.11+, Podman, uv, and all required system dependencies

4. **Implement VS Code IDE Configuration** (~3 SP)
   - Brief: Create VS Code workspace settings and extension recommendations for standardized IDE setup; integrate with setup script to configure IDE automatically based on user preference

5. **Implement Environment Validation and Health Checks** (~3 SP)
   - Brief: Add validation steps to setup script verifying environment health, dependency installation, IDE configuration, and server startup capability

6. **Create Setup Documentation with Troubleshooting Guide** (~3 SP)
   - Brief: Write comprehensive setup documentation covering quick start instructions, interactive vs silent mode, IDE setup, platform-specific considerations, common errors, and troubleshooting steps

**Total Estimated Story Points:** ~20 SP

**Estimated Sprints:** 2-3 sprints (assuming 2-week sprints with team velocity of 8-10 SP per sprint)

### Decomposition Strategy

**Strategy:** Decompose by **technical component** with logical dependencies

**Rationale:**
- Repository structure must exist before setup script can populate it (dependency: Story 2 โ Story 1)
- Devbox configuration defines environment where setup script executes (dependency: Story 3 โ Story 1)
- IDE configuration depends on repository structure being established (dependency: Story 2 โ Story 4)
- Validation depends on setup script and IDE configuration completing successfully (dependency: Stories 1,4 โ Story 5)
- Documentation references all components, written after implementation (dependency: Stories 1-5 โ Story 6)

**Implementation Order:**
1. Repository structure (foundation)
2. Devbox configuration (environment definition)
3. Setup script with interactive prompts and silent mode (automation)
4. IDE configuration (VS Code setup)
5. Validation (verification)
6. Documentation (knowledge capture)

## Decisions Made

This section documents decisions made during High-Level Story refinement based on stakeholder feedback (per `/feedback/HLS-001_v1_comments.md`).

### Decision D1: IDE/Editor Configuration Scope
**Original Question:** Should setup script include IDE/editor configuration, or leave that to developer preference?

**Decision:** System setup script (dotfiles) will handle initial IDE editor configuration. Standardize on Visual Studio Code with extensions. IDE Setup with extensions must be clearly documented. Developers are free to install additional extensions.

**Date:** 2025-10-13

**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

**Rationale:** Standardization improves consistency and reduces setup time for most developers while maintaining flexibility for customization. VS Code has broad adoption and excellent Python/development support.

**Impact:**
- Added IDE configuration to scope (previously out of scope)
- New backlog story: "Implement VS Code IDE Configuration" (~3 SP)
- Total estimated story points increased from ~16 SP to ~20 SP
- Documentation must cover VS Code extensions and configuration
- Developers maintain freedom to add additional extensions or use alternative IDEs

---

### Decision D2: Setup Output Verbosity
**Original Question:** Do developers prefer verbose output showing every step, or concise output with progress indicators?

**Decision:** Verbose with progress indicators

**Date:** 2025-10-13

**Stakeholders:** UX Design, Senior Engineers

**Rationale:** Verbose output aids troubleshooting when issues occur while progress indicators maintain clarity and show overall completion status. Best of both approaches.

**Impact:**
- Setup script must display detailed step information
- Setup script must show progress indicators (progress bars, percentage complete)
- Balances transparency (verbose) with user experience (progress tracking)
- Documentation should explain output format and how to interpret progress

---

### Decision D3: Interactive Prompts vs Defaults
**Original Question:** Should the setup script offer interactive prompts for configuration options, or use sensible defaults?

**Decision:** Interactive prompts for config options with sensible defaults for silent setup

**Date:** 2025-10-13

**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, DevOps Team

**Rationale:** Interactive mode enables customization for developers who need it; silent mode with defaults enables automation in CI/CD pipelines. Dual-mode approach serves both use cases.

**Impact:**
- Setup script must support two modes: interactive (default) and silent (via `--silent` flag)
- All configuration options require sensible defaults
- Interactive mode prompts for preferences with defaults shown
- Silent mode uses all defaults without prompts (for CI/automation)
- New acceptance criteria added (Criterion 4, Criterion 5)
- Documentation must cover both modes and when to use each

---

## Dependencies

### User Story Dependencies

- **Depends On:** None - This is the foundation story enabling all subsequent development
- **Blocks:**
  - HLS-002: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (cannot configure pipeline without working local environment)
  - HLS-003: Application Skeleton Implementation (developers need working environments to implement features)
  - All subsequent feature stories (foundation prerequisite)

### External Dependencies

- **Devbox:** External tool for isolated development environments - must be preinstalled by developers via dotfiles/system-setup
- **uv Package Manager:** External Python package manager - installed by setup script if not present
- **Podman:** Container runtime - required for future database containers, validated during setup
- **Git:** Version control system - required for cloning repository, validated during setup
- **VS Code:** Visual Studio Code - IDE standardized for team (Decision D1)

## Non-Functional Requirements (User-Facing Only)

- **Usability:**
  - Setup script must provide clear verbose progress indicators showing current step, detailed actions, and estimated time remaining
  - Interactive prompts must clearly show sensible defaults and allow quick acceptance via Enter key
  - Error messages must be actionable with specific resolution steps (not technical stack traces)
  - Documentation must be accessible to developers with varying experience levels (senior to mid-level)

- **Accessibility:**
  - Documentation must use clear, unambiguous language avoiding jargon where possible
  - Setup output must be readable in standard terminal configurations (not color-dependent)
  - Troubleshooting section must be searchable with clear section headings
  - VS Code configuration must include accessibility extensions and settings

- **Localization:**
  - Initial version: English only (US)
  - Future consideration: Translate documentation for international development teams

- **Compliance:**
  - Setup script must not transmit any user data or telemetry without explicit opt-in consent
  - All downloaded dependencies must use verifiable checksums preventing supply chain attacks
  - Environment configuration must not expose secrets or sensitive information in logs

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Setup script fails on Windows WSL2** | High - blocks Windows developers | Include WSL2-specific testing in validation. Document WSL2 distribution requirements. Provide Devbox-based approach for cross-platform consistency |
| **Devbox adoption resistance** | Medium - developers prefer traditional venv | Document clear benefits (isolation, reproducibility). Provide troubleshooting for common issues. Gather feedback during onboarding to iterate |
| **VS Code standardization resistance** | Low-Medium - some developers prefer other IDEs | Document Decision D1 rationale. Allow developers to skip IDE setup during prompts. Provide clear documentation that other IDEs are supported but not configured automatically |
| **Network-dependent setup fails in restricted environments** | Medium - blocks developers in corporate networks with firewalls | Test setup in network-restricted environment. Document proxy configuration. Provide offline installation guide for air-gapped scenarios |
| **Documentation becomes outdated as tools evolve** | Medium - increases onboarding friction over time | Treat documentation as code (reviewed in PRs). Validate during each new developer onboarding. Include documentation updates in definition of done |
