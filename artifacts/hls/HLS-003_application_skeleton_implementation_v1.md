## User Story Statement

**As a** software engineer implementing new MCP tools for the AI Agent server,
**I want** a working application skeleton with documented patterns and examples,
**So that** I can implement new tools following established conventions without making foundational architectural decisions, enabling rapid feature development with consistent code quality.

## User Context

### Target Persona

**Primary:** Senior Backend Engineer (PRD-000 Persona 1)
- 5-10 years of experience building distributed systems
- Comfortable with FastAPI, async patterns, dependency injection
- Seeks efficient, well-documented infrastructure patterns
- Values clear extension points for implementing new features without boilerplate
- Expects production-quality patterns from day one (not prototypes requiring refactoring)

**Secondary:** New Team Member / Mid-Level Engineer (PRD-000 Persona 2)
- 2-4 years of Python experience
- Less familiar with advanced async patterns and microservices architecture
- Requires clear documentation and examples to navigate codebase
- Needs code examples and templates demonstrating standard patterns
- Benefits from "learning by example" approach to understand architectural decisions

**User Characteristics:**
- Implements new MCP tools weekly (1-3 new tools per sprint typical)
- Reviews existing code to understand patterns before implementing features
- Frustrated by scattered knowledge and lack of documented patterns (per PRD-000 Problem Statement Pain Point 3)
- Values working examples over abstract documentation (code demonstrates patterns better than descriptions)
- Expects modern Python patterns (type hints, Pydantic validation, async/await)

### User Journey Context

This story fits within the feature development lifecycle:
- **Before this story:** Developer clones repository, sees empty src/ directory or minimal boilerplate, must make architectural decisions about application structure, dependency injection, error handling, and MCP integration patterns
- **This story enables:** Developer reviews working application skeleton with example tool, understands patterns through concrete code, implements new tools by copying and adapting example patterns
- **After this story:** Developer implements new MCP tools confidently following established patterns, focuses on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns

This story is foundational for all feature epics (EPIC-001 through EPIC-005), as the application skeleton establishes architectural patterns that all subsequent features build upon.

## Business Value

### User Value

**For Developers:**
- **Rapid Onboarding:** Review working example tool to understand MCP integration patterns in minutes rather than hours of documentation reading
- **Pattern Consistency:** Follow established patterns demonstrated in example code, ensuring consistent architecture across all tools
- **Reduced Decision Paralysis:** Avoid making foundational architectural decisions for each new tool implementation
- **Clear Extension Points:** Identify exactly where to add new functionality without modifying core application code
- **Learning by Example:** Understand FastAPI patterns, dependency injection, Pydantic validation, and MCP integration through working code rather than abstract documentation
- **Confidence in Implementation:** Follow proven patterns reducing risk of architectural mistakes requiring refactoring

**For Team:**
- **Architectural Consistency:** All developers implement tools using same patterns, improving code maintainability and review efficiency
- **Reduced Code Review Friction:** Reviews focus on business logic rather than debating architectural approaches
- **Knowledge Distribution:** Application skeleton documents institutional knowledge in code rather than individual developer expertise

### Business Value

**Quantified Impact (per PRD-000 Goals & Success Metrics):**
- **Accelerated Feature Delivery:** Enables 100% of feature epics (EPIC-001 through EPIC-005) to begin without infrastructure blockers (PRD-000 Goal 3)
- **Reduced Time-to-First-Contribution:** Reduces new team member time-to-first-PR from 3-5 days to <2 days by providing clear examples (PRD-000 Goal 4)
- **Code Quality Baseline:** Establishes production-quality patterns (type safety, validation, error handling) from day one, reducing technical debt accumulation
- **Development Velocity:** Reduces time to implement new MCP tool from 2-3 days (without patterns) to 1 day (with patterns), estimated 50% velocity improvement

**Strategic Value:**
- Enables INIT-001 strategic objective: "Deploy agentic AI systems in weeks instead of months" by eliminating architectural decision overhead for each feature
- Positions project as reference architecture for enterprise MCP deployments by demonstrating production-ready patterns (addresses Business Research ยง3.1 Gap 1)
- Creates reusable knowledge asset: application skeleton patterns can be extracted into organizational template repository for future projects

### Success Criteria

**Primary Success Metrics:**
1. **Framework Readiness:** 100% of feature epics confirm no architectural blockers to begin work (PRD-000 Goal 3)
2. **Pattern Adoption:** >90% of new tool implementations follow established patterns from example tool (observable through code review feedback)
3. **Time-to-First-Contribution:** New team member merges first PR within <2 days (PRD-000 Goal 4)
4. **Reduced Architectural Debates:** Code reviews focus on business logic (>80%) rather than architectural concerns (<20%)

**User Satisfaction Metrics:**
1. Developer surveys confirm application skeleton provides clear guidance for implementing new tools
2. New team members report understanding project architecture through example tool review
3. Senior engineers confirm example patterns are production-quality (no refactoring needed as features scale)

## Functional Requirements (High-Level)

### Primary User Flow

**Happy Path: Developer Implements New MCP Tool Following Example Patterns**

1. **Developer receives feature assignment** to implement new MCP tool (e.g., "Add JIRA backlog retrieval tool")
2. **Developer reviews application skeleton** to understand project structure:
   - Navigates repository structure (src/ directory layout)
   - Identifies example tool location and reviews implementation
   - Understands dependency injection patterns and FastAPI integration
3. **Developer reviews example tool implementation** to understand patterns:
   - Examines MCP tool definition using FastMCP decorators
   - Reviews Pydantic input validation models demonstrating type-safe request handling
   - Studies error handling and response patterns
   - Identifies testing patterns from example tool's test suite
4. **Developer creates new tool by adapting example**:
   - Copies example tool structure as starting point
   - Modifies business logic for new tool's requirements
   - Updates Pydantic models for new tool's input/output
   - Implements error handling following example patterns
   - Creates tests following example tool's test structure
5. **Developer validates implementation locally**:
   - Runs health check endpoint to confirm server starts successfully
   - Tests new tool using MCP client or curl
   - Runs automated tests to validate functionality
6. **Developer commits code with confidence**:
   - Code follows established patterns observable in example
   - Implementation consistent with team's architectural decisions
   - Ready for code review without foundational architectural concerns

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Alt Flow 1 (Architecture Understanding):** If developer is new to project, they start local development server, verify health check endpoint responds, review API documentation (auto-generated by FastAPI), then review example tool implementation to understand architecture before implementing new tool
- **Alt Flow 2 (Pattern Extension):** If developer needs capability not demonstrated in example tool (e.g., database access), they identify extension point in dependency injection system, review documentation for adding new dependencies, implement following established patterns
- **Alt Flow 3 (Error Scenario Testing):** Developer reviews example tool's error handling patterns (validation errors, external service failures), implements similar error handling for new tool, tests error scenarios using example tool's test patterns as reference

### User Interactions

**What the Developer Does:**
- Reviews application skeleton structure to understand project organization
- Examines example tool implementation to learn MCP integration patterns
- Studies Pydantic models to understand input validation approach
- Reviews dependency injection setup to understand how to access shared services
- Adapts example patterns when implementing new tools
- Tests new tool implementation using health check endpoint and local server
- References example tool's test suite when writing tests for new tools

**What the Developer Does NOT Do (Provided by Application Skeleton):**
- Make architectural decisions about application structure
- Design dependency injection patterns from scratch
- Research MCP protocol integration approaches
- Determine error handling conventions
- Design API endpoint structure
- Implement health check and monitoring endpoints
- Set up logging and configuration patterns

### System Behaviors (User Perspective)

**What the Application Skeleton Provides from Developer's Point of View:**
- **Clear Project Structure:** Repository follows standard Python src layout with intuitive organization
- **Working Server:** Application starts successfully with minimal configuration, demonstrating FastAPI integration
- **Health Check Visibility:** Health check endpoint responds with system status, demonstrating operational patterns
- **Example Tool Demonstration:** Complete tool implementation demonstrates all key patterns (MCP integration, validation, error handling, testing)
- **Self-Documenting Code:** Example code includes docstrings, type hints, and comments explaining patterns
- **Extension Points:** Dependency injection configuration clearly indicates where to add new services
- **Testing Foundation:** Example tests demonstrate unit testing patterns, fixtures, and mocking approaches

## Acceptance Criteria (High-Level)

### Criterion 1: Working FastAPI Application with Health Check

**Given** a developer has cloned the repository and completed environment setup
**When** the developer starts the application server locally
**Then** the server starts successfully without errors
**And** the health check endpoint (/health) responds with 200 status
**And** health check includes system information (version, status, dependencies)

### Criterion 2: Complete Example MCP Tool Implementation

**Given** a developer needs to implement a new MCP tool
**When** the developer reviews the example tool implementation
**Then** the example demonstrates all essential patterns:
- MCP tool definition using FastMCP decorators
- Pydantic input validation models with type safety
- Error handling for validation failures and external service errors
- Asynchronous patterns for I/O operations
- Response formatting and serialization
**And** example code includes docstrings explaining patterns
**And** example code follows project coding standards (type hints, formatting, naming conventions)

### Criterion 3: Dependency Injection Pattern Demonstrated

**Given** a developer needs to understand how to access shared services in tools
**When** the developer reviews the application structure
**Then** dependency injection configuration is clearly documented
**And** example tool demonstrates how to inject dependencies (configuration, logging, external services)
**And** developer can identify where to register new dependencies for their tools

### Criterion 4: Testing Patterns Demonstrated

**Given** a developer needs to write tests for new MCP tool
**When** the developer reviews the example tool's test suite
**Then** tests demonstrate key patterns:
- Unit tests for tool business logic
- Pydantic model validation testing
- Mocking external dependencies
- Testing error handling scenarios
- Async test patterns using pytest-asyncio
**And** tests follow project testing standards (>80% coverage, clear assertions)

### Criterion 5: Documentation Enables Self-Service Implementation

**Given** a new team member with Python experience but no project context
**When** the team member reviews application skeleton documentation and example tool
**Then** team member can implement a simple MCP tool (similar complexity to example) within 4 hours
**And** team member's implementation follows established patterns without requiring code review corrections for architectural concerns

### Edge Cases & Error Conditions

- **Incomplete Dependencies:** If developer has not completed environment setup (HLS-001), health check endpoint displays error indicating missing dependencies with clear resolution guidance
- **Configuration Errors:** If application configuration is invalid, server startup fails with actionable error message indicating specific configuration issue
- **Example Tool External Dependency Unavailable:** If example tool requires external service (for demonstration), tool gracefully handles unavailability with clear error message (demonstrates error handling patterns)

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope

- FastAPI application skeleton with working server startup
- Health check endpoint with system status reporting
- Example MCP tool implementation demonstrating key patterns
- Pydantic models for input validation in example tool
- Dependency injection configuration with example usage
- Error handling patterns in example tool (validation errors, external failures)
- Test suite for example tool demonstrating testing patterns
- Application structure following Python src layout
- Configuration management pattern (environment variables with Pydantic validation)
- Basic logging setup (structured logging deferred to EPIC-004)

### Out of Scope (Deferred to Future Stories or Epics)

- **Production observability instrumentation:** Metrics, tracing, advanced logging deferred to EPIC-004 (Production-Ready Observability) per PRD-000 Decision D6
- **Multiple example tools for different patterns:** Single comprehensive example sufficient for foundation; additional examples can be added as features implemented
- **Database integration patterns:** Application skeleton includes placeholder database configuration, but full database patterns demonstrated when first database-backed feature implemented (EPIC-002 or later)
- **Authentication and authorization patterns:** Deferred to EPIC-003 (Security Integration) when authentication implemented
- **Advanced MCP protocol features:** Example tool demonstrates core patterns; advanced protocol features (streaming, cancellation) demonstrated when needed in feature epics
- **Production deployment configuration:** Container configuration deferred to HLS-005, Kubernetes deployment to EPIC-005

5. **Document Application Architecture and Patterns** (~2 SP)
   - Brief: Write architecture documentation explaining application structure, dependency injection, and extension points with references to example tool

**Total Estimated Story Points:** ~16 SP
**Estimated Sprints:** 2 sprints (standard 2-week sprints with team of 2 engineers)

### Decomposition Strategy

**Strategy:** Decompose by architectural layer and example completeness

**Rationale:**
- Story 1 establishes foundational application structure (FastAPI setup, configuration, health check)
- Story 2 adds dependency injection enabling tools to access shared services
- Story 3 builds on stories 1-2 to implement example tool demonstrating integration patterns
- Story 4 adds testing dimension demonstrating quality patterns
- Story 5 documents architecture for discoverability
- Each story delivers independently testable value (can validate each layer separately)
- Stories 3-4 can be implemented in parallel after stories 1-2 complete

**Recommended Implementation Order:**
1. Story 1 (Application Structure) - **MUST complete first** to establish foundation
2. Story 2 (Dependency Injection) - **MUST complete before Story 3** (example tool needs DI)
3. Stories 3-4 (Example Tool + Tests) - Can be implemented in parallel by two engineers
4. Story 5 (Documentation) - Implement last after architecture proven through stories 1-4

## Dependencies

### User Story Dependencies

- **Depends On:** HLS-001 (Development Environment Setup) - MUST be completed first
  - Application skeleton requires working development environment to run and test
  - Repository structure established by HLS-001 provides foundation for application code
  - Development tooling (Python, uv, testing frameworks) required to develop and validate application

- **Depends On:** HLS-002 (CI/CD Pipeline Setup) - SHOULD be completed first
  - Automated testing validates example tool implementation follows quality standards
  - Type checking validates application code demonstrates type safety patterns
  - CI/CD pipeline provides confidence in application skeleton quality

- **Blocks:** HLS-004 (Development Documentation & Workflow Standards)
  - Development workflow documentation references application skeleton patterns and example tool
  - Code review checklist references patterns demonstrated in application skeleton

- **Blocks:** All feature epics (EPIC-001 through EPIC-005)
  - Feature implementation requires application skeleton as foundation
  - New tools will follow patterns established by example tool

### External Dependencies

- **FastAPI Framework:** Web framework availability and version compatibility (PRD-000 specifies FastAPI >= 0.100.0)
- **FastMCP SDK:** Official Python MCP SDK for tool integration (PRD-000 specifies mcp-sdk >= 0.1.0)
- **Pydantic Library:** Data validation library version compatibility (PRD-000 specifies Pydantic >= 2.0.0)

## Non-Functional Requirements (User-Facing Only)

**Note:** Technical NFRs (performance targets, infrastructure architecture) are documented in PRD-000. Only user-facing NFRs included here.

- **Usability:**
  - Example tool must be simple enough to understand in <15 minutes of review
  - Code structure must follow "principle of least surprise" (conventional patterns, no custom abstractions)
  - Dependency injection must be explicit and obvious (avoid "magic" that obscures behavior)
  - Error messages in example tool must be actionable with specific guidance

- **Accessibility:**
  - Code documentation (docstrings, comments) must explain WHY patterns chosen, not just WHAT code does
  - Example tool complexity appropriate for mid-level engineers (2-4 years experience)
  - Architecture documentation includes visual diagrams supplemented by detailed text descriptions

- **Maintainability (Developer Perspective):**
  - Application structure follows standard Python src layout enabling intuitive navigation
  - Example tool demonstrates patterns scalable to production (not simplified prototypes requiring refactoring)
  - Dependency injection enables testing and swapping implementations without code changes
  - Clear separation of concerns (business logic, validation, error handling) visible in example

- **Learnability:**
  - New team member with FastAPI experience can understand application architecture within 1 hour
  - New team member with Python experience but no FastAPI experience can implement similar tool to example within 4 hours (with documentation)
  - Example patterns documented with references to specialized CLAUDE.md files for deep-dive learning

## Risks & Decisions Made

### Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Example tool too simple** | Medium - doesn't demonstrate production patterns, developers unsure how to handle complexity | Design example tool with realistic complexity (external service call, error handling, async patterns). Review with senior engineers before finalizing. Include complexity rationale in documentation. |
| **Example tool too complex** | Medium - intimidates new team members, reduces onboarding velocity | Balance complexity with clarity. Add extensive documentation explaining each pattern. Consider second simpler example if needed (defer to feedback). Survey team during implementation. |
| **Dependency injection pattern unfamiliar** | Medium - developers struggle to add new dependencies, bypass pattern with global state | Provide clear documentation with step-by-step guide for adding dependencies. Include second example in documentation showing dependency addition. Review documentation with new team member for clarity. |
| **Example becomes outdated** | Low - as patterns evolve, example lags behind, new developers learn outdated patterns | Treat example tool as living documentation. Include in code review checklist: "Does this PR make example tool outdated?" Update example proactively when patterns change. |
| **FastMCP SDK breaking changes** | Medium - SDK updates require example tool refactoring, temporary broken state | Pin SDK major version. Monitor SDK changelog. Test SDK updates in isolated branch. Coordinate SDK updates with team (not during active feature work). |

### Decisions Made

**The following decisions were made during Product Owner review and resolve the high-level story uncertainties:**

**D1: Example Tool External Service Integration**
- **Question:** Should example tool demonstrate external service integration (e.g., HTTP API call), or focus purely on MCP protocol patterns without external dependencies?
- **Decision:** Focus purely on MCP protocol patterns without external dependencies
- **Rationale:** Simplicity and focus on MCP patterns take priority for foundational example. External service integration adds complexity and potential failure modes that may distract from core pattern learning. External service patterns can be demonstrated in feature epic implementations where they naturally occur.

**D2: Number of Example Tools**
- **Question:** Should application skeleton include multiple example tools demonstrating different patterns (simple vs. complex, synchronous vs. asynchronous), or single comprehensive example sufficient?
- **Decision:** Single comprehensive example tool
- **Rationale:** Single well-documented example reduces initial setup complexity and maintenance burden while providing sufficient pattern coverage for MVP. Additional examples can be added based on actual team feedback during first sprint if needed. Quality over quantity for learning materials.

**D3: Example Tool Business Logic Realism**
- **Question:** Should example tool business logic be realistic (e.g., 'format code snippet') or abstract/dummy (e.g., 'echo input')?
- **Decision:** Simple "Hello World" style business logic (abstract/dummy)
- **Rationale:** Abstract logic keeps focus on architectural patterns rather than business logic complexity. Developers can understand MCP integration, Pydantic validation, and error handling without being distracted by domain-specific business rules. Realistic business logic will emerge naturally in feature implementations.

**D4: Documentation Location Strategy**
- **Question:** What level of documentation should be in code (docstrings/comments) vs. separate architecture documentation?
- **Decision:** Follow "documentation-driven development" approach - start with comprehensive inline documentation (docstrings/comments), extract to separate architecture documentation during Story 5
- **Rationale:** Inline documentation keeps patterns immediately visible when reviewing code, critical for "learning by example" approach. During Story 5 (Documentation), extract architectural concepts to separate docs for broader context while maintaining inline docs for implementation details. This hybrid approach serves both code review and architectural understanding needs.
