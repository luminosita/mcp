## Functional Requirements (High-Level)

### Primary User Flow

**Happy Path: New Team Member Self-Service Onboarding Using Documentation**

1. **New team member joins project** and receives repository access
2. **Team member discovers primary documentation** through README.md quick start guide
3. **Team member reviews environment setup documentation**:
   - Follows step-by-step setup instructions referencing HLS-001 (Development Environment Setup)
   - Uses `task setup` to configure environment following documented workflow
   - Validates setup using `task info` as documented
4. **Team member discovers available commands** using `task --list` (self-documenting interface)
5. **Team member reviews development workflow documentation**:
   - Understands branching strategy (feature branches, main branch protection)
   - Learns code review process and expectations
   - Reviews coding standards with references to specialized CLAUDE.md files
   - Understands testing requirements and coverage expectations
6. **Team member reviews example workflow**:
   - Follows documented example: "Implementing a new MCP tool"
   - Sees complete workflow from feature branch creation through PR merge
   - References Taskfile commands used at each workflow stage
7. **Team member implements first feature** following documented workflow:
   - Creates feature branch following branching strategy
   - Implements feature following coding standards and example patterns
   - Runs quality checks using documented Taskfile commands (`task check`)
   - Commits code with pre-commit hooks as documented
   - Creates PR using documented PR template
8. **Team member's PR reviewed** using documented review checklist:
   - Reviewer uses checklist to ensure completeness
   - Review focuses on logic and design (standards compliance automated/documented)
   - Team member addresses feedback understanding documented standards
9. **Team member merges first PR** within <2 days, achieving productivity milestone

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Alt Flow 1 (Troubleshooting Reference):** If team member encounters issue, they reference troubleshooting section in documentation, find solution documented for common issues, resolve independently without escalation
- **Alt Flow 2 (Standards Clarification):** If code reviewer and author disagree on standard, they reference coding standards documentation as authoritative source, resolve debate objectively
- **Alt Flow 3 (Documentation Update):** If team member discovers gap or inaccuracy in documentation, they submit PR updating documentation following documented contribution process (documentation as code)

### User Interactions

**What the Team Member Does:**
- Reviews documentation to understand workflows before contributing
- Follows documented branching strategy when creating feature branches
- Uses documented Taskfile commands for development operations (`task dev`, `task test`, `task check`)
- Discovers new commands through `task --list` as needed
- References code review checklist when preparing PR for review
- References coding standards documentation when implementing features
- Consults specialized CLAUDE.md files for deep-dive on specific topics (testing, typing, validation, architecture)
- Updates documentation when discovering gaps (documentation as code)

**What the Team Member Does NOT Do (Documented/Automated):**
- Ask senior engineers to explain branching strategy (documented)
- Memorize dozens of tool-specific commands (unified via `task` interface)
- Guess at code review expectations (documented checklist)
- Debate coding standards without reference (documented with CLAUDE.md references)
- Search Slack history for setup instructions (comprehensive setup documentation)

### System Behaviors (User Perspective)

**What the Documentation Provides from User's Point of View:**
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Documentation covers complete development lifecycle from setup through PR merge
- **Step-by-Step Guidance:** Workflows documented with concrete steps and examples
- **Visual Aids:** Diagrams supplement text for complex workflows (branching strategy, CI/CD pipeline flow)
- **Command Reference:** Taskfile provides self-documenting command interface via `task --list`
- **Examples:** Concrete workflow examples demonstrate practices (not just abstract descriptions)
- **Troubleshooting:** Common issues documented with resolution guidance
- **Standards Authority:** Documentation serves as objective reference for standards debates
- **Discoverability:** Clear navigation structure enables finding relevant documentation quickly

## Acceptance Criteria (High-Level)

### Criterion 1: Comprehensive Workflow Documentation Complete

**Given** a new team member has joined the project
**When** the team member reviews development workflow documentation
**Then** documentation covers all essential workflows:
- Branching strategy with examples (feature branches, main branch protection)
- Code review process with checklist
- Testing expectations and coverage requirements
- Unified CLI commands via Taskfile for all development operations
**And** documentation includes visual diagrams for complex workflows
**And** documentation references specialized CLAUDE.md files for detailed standards

### Criterion 2: Self-Service Onboarding Achievable

**Given** a new team member with Python experience but no project context
**When** the team member follows documentation independently
**Then** team member achieves working development environment using documented setup process
**And** team member understands development workflow without requiring senior engineer mentoring
**And** team member can implement simple feature following documented patterns and standards
**And** team member merges first PR within <2 days (PRD-000 Goal 4)

### Criterion 3: Code Review Checklist Provided

**Given** a developer is preparing PR for review or reviewing PR
**When** the developer references code review checklist
**Then** checklist covers all essential review criteria:
- Code quality standards (linting, formatting, type safety)
- Test coverage requirements (>80% coverage, test quality)
- Documentation requirements (docstrings, README updates)
- Security considerations (no secrets, input validation)
**And** checklist references automated checks (CI/CD pipeline validation)
**And** checklist focuses reviewer attention on design and logic (not style)

### Criterion 4: Coding Standards Documented with References

**Given** a developer implementing feature needs coding standards guidance
**When** the developer reviews coding standards documentation
**Then** documentation covers project-specific standards:
- Python style guidelines (PEP 8 + project conventions)
- Type hints requirements (mypy --strict compliance)
- Pydantic validation patterns
- Testing patterns and conventions
- Architecture patterns (dependency injection, error handling)
**And** documentation references specialized CLAUDE.md files for detailed guidance
**And** documentation explains rationale for standards (not just rules)

### Criterion 5: Unified CLI Interface Documented and Discoverable

**Given** a developer needs to run development operation
**When** the developer uses `task --list` command
**Then** all available development tasks are displayed with descriptions
**And** tasks are organized into logical categories (setup, testing, linting, containers, database)
**And** developer can execute any operation using consistent `task <command>` interface
**And** documentation includes reference to Taskfile commands for common workflows

### Edge Cases & Error Conditions

- **Documentation Becomes Outdated:** Documentation treated as code, reviewed in PRs, updated when practices change. Validation during new team member onboarding confirms accuracy.
- **Documentation Conflicts with Code:** If documented standard conflicts with observed code patterns, team prioritizes updating documentation or refactoring code for consistency. Documentation is source of truth.
- **Specialized CLAUDE.md Files Unavailable:** If specialized files not yet created, documentation references planned files and provides basic guidance inline until specialized files available.
- **Team Member Discovers Gap:** If team member cannot find documentation for workflow, they ask in Slack, document answer in PR updating documentation (documentation as code).

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope

- Development workflow documentation (branching strategy, feature development flow)
- Code review process documentation with checklist
- Coding standards documentation with specialized CLAUDE.md references
- Testing standards and coverage requirements
- Unified CLI interface documentation (Taskfile command reference via `task --list`)

- **Advanced observability documentation:** Deferred to EPIC-004 (Production-Ready Observability) per PRD-000 Decision D6
- **Feature-specific implementation guides:** Documentation focuses on foundational workflows; feature-specific guides created with feature epics
- **API documentation for MCP tools:** Auto-generated by FastAPI; user-facing API docs deferred to first external users
- **Onboarding video tutorials:** MVP uses text documentation with diagrams; video content deferred to post-launch
- **Internationalization of documentation:** English documentation only for MVP; additional languages deferred

## Decomposition into Backlog Stories

### Estimated Backlog Stories (Not Yet Detailed)

1. **Create Development Workflow Documentation** (~3 SP)
   - Brief: Document branching strategy, feature development workflow, and Git conventions with visual diagrams and concrete examples

2. **Create Code Review Process Documentation** (~2 SP)
   - Brief: Document code review process and create review checklist covering quality, testing, documentation, and security standards

3. **Create Coding Standards Documentation** (~3 SP)
   - Brief: Document project-specific coding standards with references to specialized CLAUDE.md files and rationale for standards

4. **Document Unified CLI Interface and Taskfile Commands** (~2 SP)
   - Brief: Document Taskfile as unified CLI interface, organize tasks into categories, ensure `task --list` provides comprehensive command reference

5. **Create Visual Workflow Diagrams** (~2 SP)
   - Brief: Create visual diagrams for complex workflows (branching strategy, CI/CD pipeline, development flow) supplementing text documentation

6. **Validate Documentation with New Team Member** (~1 SP)
   - Brief: Conduct onboarding with new team member using only documentation, gather feedback, iterate documentation based on gaps discovered

**Total Estimated Story Points:** ~13 SP
**Estimated Sprints:** 2 sprints (standard 2-week sprints with team of 1 engineer + 0.5 technical writer)

### Decomposition Strategy

**Strategy:** Decompose by documentation type and validation

**Rationale:**
- Stories 1-4 address different documentation domains (workflow, review, standards, CLI)
- Story 5 adds visual dimension enhancing text documentation
- Story 6 validates documentation completeness through real onboarding
- Stories 1-4 can be implemented in parallel by engineer and technical writer collaboration
- Story 5 can be implemented in parallel with stories 1-4 (diagrams supplement text)
- Story 6 must be implemented last to validate complete documentation set

**Recommended Implementation Order:**
1. Stories 1-5 (All Documentation Types) - Can be implemented in parallel by engineer + technical writer
2. Story 6 (Validation) - **MUST complete last** to validate documentation completeness through real onboarding

**Collaboration Pattern:**
- Technical writer drafts structure and examples
- Senior engineer provides technical accuracy review
- New team member validates during onboarding (Story 6)

## Dependencies

### User Story Dependencies

- **Depends On:** HLS-001 (Development Environment Setup) - MUST be completed first
  - Documentation references environment setup process and Taskfile commands established by HLS-001

- **Depends On:** HLS-002 (CI/CD Pipeline Setup) - MUST be completed first
  - Documentation references CI/CD pipeline, pre-commit hooks, and automated validation in workflow descriptions

- **Depends On:** HLS-003 (Application Skeleton Implementation) - MUST be completed first
  - Documentation references application skeleton patterns and example tool in coding standards and workflow examples

- **Blocks:** All feature epics (EPIC-001 through EPIC-005)
  - Feature development requires documented workflows for team collaboration
  - New team members joining for feature work need documentation for onboarding

### External Dependencies

- **Specialized CLAUDE.md Files:** Documentation references specialized files (CLAUDE-tooling.md, CLAUDE-testing.md, CLAUDE-typing.md, CLAUDE-validation.md, CLAUDE-architecture.md)
  - These files should exist by this point (created during HLS-001, HLS-002, HLS-003 implementation)
  - If not yet created, documentation can reference planned files and provide basic guidance inline

## Non-Functional Requirements (User-Facing Only)

**Note:** Technical NFRs (performance targets, infrastructure architecture) are documented in PRD-000. Only user-facing NFRs included here.

- **Usability:**
  - Documentation structure enables finding relevant information within <5 minutes for common questions
  - Navigation clear with table of contents and logical hierarchy
  - Examples concrete and relatable (not abstract or overly simplified)
  - Taskfile commands self-documenting through `task --list` reducing need to memorize or search documentation

- **Accessibility:**
  - Visual diagrams supplemented with detailed text descriptions for screen reader compatibility
  - Code examples include syntax highlighting and clear annotations
  - Documentation written at appropriate technical level for target audience (assumes Python proficiency, explains project-specific conventions)
  - Clear headings and structure for easy scanning and navigation

- **Maintainability (Documentation Perspective):**
  - Documentation treated as code (version controlled, reviewed in PRs)
  - Documentation updates included in definition of done for feature work
  - Specialized CLAUDE.md files provide modular documentation reducing maintenance burden
  - Taskfile.yml serves as single source of truth for command reference (documentation references, not duplicates)

- **Completeness:**
  - Documentation covers complete development lifecycle from setup through PR merge
  - Common questions answered without requiring escalation to senior engineers
  - Troubleshooting section addresses anticipated issues based on beta testing
  - Documentation validated through new team member onboarding (acceptance criterion 2)

## Risks & Decisions Made

### Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Documentation becomes outdated** | High - reduces trust, increases onboarding time, standards drift | Treat documentation as code (review in PRs). Include documentation updates in definition of done. Validate during each new team member onboarding. Schedule quarterly documentation review. |
| **Documentation too abstract** | Medium - new team members struggle to apply guidance without concrete examples | Include concrete examples for every workflow. Validate documentation with new team member before finalizing. Gather feedback during first sprint and iterate. |
| **Documentation too lengthy** | Medium - overwhelms new team members, reduces engagement | Organize with clear hierarchy and navigation. Provide quick start guide for immediate productivity. Use visual diagrams to summarize complex workflows. Separate quick reference from deep-dive content. |
| **Specialized CLAUDE.md files not created** | Medium - documentation references missing files, gaps in detailed guidance | Coordinate with HLS-001, HLS-002, HLS-003 implementation to ensure CLAUDE.md files created. Provide basic inline guidance in documentation if specialized files delayed. |
| **Team ignores documentation** | High - documentation becomes obsolete, onboarding friction persists | Make documentation authoritative source for standards debates. Reference documentation in code review feedback. Taskfile provides enforced interface reducing need to "remember" to use docs. |
| **Documentation scattered across files** | Medium - developers cannot find relevant information, reduces usability | Establish clear navigation structure (README โ CONTRIBUTING โ ARCHITECTURE). Cross-reference related sections. Consider consolidated quick reference guide. |

### Decisions Made

**The following decisions were made during Product Owner review and resolve the high-level story uncertainties:**

**D1: Video Tutorials for Documentation**
- **Question:** Should documentation include video tutorials in addition to text and diagrams, or is text + diagrams sufficient for MVP?
- **Decision:** Text + diagrams only for MVP
- **Rationale:** Text and diagrams provide sufficient learning material for MVP while minimizing creation and maintenance complexity. Video tutorials add significant production time and maintenance burden without validated ROI at foundation stage. Can gather feedback during first team member onboardings and add videos post-launch if specifically requested.

**D2: Code Review Checklist Location**
- **Question:** Should code review checklist be integrated into PR template (GitHub), kept as separate documentation, or both?
- **Decision:** Hybrid approach - brief checklist in PR template, detailed reference in documentation
- **Rationale:** PR template provides immediate visibility and enforcement of key checklist items during code review workflow. Separate detailed documentation allows comprehensive guidance without cluttering PR descriptions. This combination ensures both convenience (PR template) and depth (documentation reference).

**D3: Troubleshooting Documentation Scope**
- **Question:** What level of troubleshooting documentation is sufficient - common issues only, or comprehensive failure mode catalog?
- **Decision:** Start with common issues based on beta testing, expand based on actual support questions during first sprints
- **Rationale:** Common issues likely cover 80% of cases with 20% of effort (Pareto principle). Comprehensive failure mode catalog requires significant upfront effort without validation that all scenarios will occur. Iterative approach reduces initial documentation burden while ensuring highest-value content created first. Expand based on actual team needs.

**D4: External Resource References**
- **Question:** Should documentation reference external resources (Python best practices, FastAPI docs, MCP protocol spec), or duplicate relevant information inline?
- **Decision:** Hybrid approach - reference external for general knowledge (Python, FastAPI), inline for project-specific applications. Include "Further Reading" sections with curated external links.
- **Rationale:** External references keep documentation concise and avoid duplicating authoritative sources (Python best practices, FastAPI official docs). Inline project-specific applications demonstrate how to apply general knowledge to this codebase. "Further Reading" sections provide curated learning paths without overwhelming core documentation. This approach balances accessibility with maintainability.
