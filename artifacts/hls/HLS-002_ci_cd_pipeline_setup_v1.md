**User Persona Source:** PRD-000 Section 4 - User Personas (Senior Backend Engineer, New Team Member)

## User Story Statement

**As a** software engineer contributing code to the AI Agent MCP Server project,
**I want** automated build validation and quality checks to run on every commit,
**So that** I receive immediate feedback on code quality, integration issues, and test failures without manual intervention, enabling confident contributions and preventing defects from reaching the main branch.

## User Context

### Target Persona

**Primary:** Senior Backend Engineer (PRD-000 Persona 1)
- 5-10 years of experience building distributed systems
- Values efficient workflows with automated validation catching integration errors early
- Needs immediate feedback on code changes to maintain development velocity
- Expects continuous integration as standard practice in professional development environments

**Secondary:** New Team Member / Mid-Level Engineer (PRD-000 Persona 2)
- 2-4 years of Python experience
- Requires quick feedback loops through automated validation to learn project standards
- Benefits from automated checks preventing common mistakes before code review
- Needs clear visibility into build status and failure causes

**User Characteristics:**
- Commits code multiple times per day (5-15 commits typical)
- Works on feature branches before merging to main
- Expects CI/CD pipelines as standard infrastructure (not optional)
- Frustrated by manual deployment processes and late-stage integration failures (per PRD-000 Problem Statement Pain Point 4)
- Values fast feedback loops (PRD-000 target: <5 minutes from commit to results)

### User Journey Context

This story fits within the standard feature development workflow:
- **Before this story:** Developer implements features locally, runs local tests manually, commits code without automated validation
- **This story enables:** Automated validation on every commit providing immediate feedback on code quality, type safety, test coverage, and security vulnerabilities
- **After this story:** Developer merges approved PRs confident that automated checks have validated integration, enabling continuous deployment to development environments

This story is foundational for all subsequent feature epics (EPIC-001 through EPIC-005), as automated validation enables rapid, confident development at scale.

## Business Value

### User Value

**For Developers:**
- **Immediate Feedback:** Receive build results within 5 minutes of commit, catching issues while context is fresh
- **Reduced Context Switching:** Avoid discovering integration issues hours or days later when context has been lost
- **Confidence in Changes:** Automated validation provides objective confirmation that changes meet quality standards
- **Learning Acceleration:** New team members learn project standards through automated feedback rather than code review critique (reduces learning curve from weeks to days)
- **Reduced Manual Work:** Eliminate manual test execution, linting, and quality checks before commits

**For Team:**
- **Consistent Standards Enforcement:** Automated checks apply standards uniformly across all contributors
- **Higher Code Review Quality:** Reviews focus on design and logic rather than style violations and test coverage
- **Protected Main Branch:** Automated validation prevents broken code from reaching main branch

### Business Value

**Quantified Impact (per PRD-000 Goals & Success Metrics):**
- **Defect Prevention:** Reduces integration defects by catching failures at commit time instead of staging (estimated 70-80% reduction in staging bugs based on industry CI/CD adoption studies)
- **Team Velocity:** Accelerates feature delivery by removing manual validation bottlenecks (PRD-000 target: pipeline execution <5 minutes vs. 30-60 minutes for manual deployment)
- **Onboarding Acceleration:** Reduces new team member onboarding time from 3-5 days to <1 day by providing automated feedback on standards compliance (per PRD-000 Goal 4)
- **Quality Baseline:** Maintains >80% test coverage threshold automatically, ensuring quality consistency across all feature work

**Strategic Value:**
- Enables INIT-001 strategic objective: "Deploy agentic AI systems in weeks instead of months" by eliminating manual integration bottlenecks
- Establishes foundation for continuous deployment (deferred to EPIC-005) by proving automated validation pipeline
- Positions project as reference architecture for enterprise MCP deployments by addressing Business Research ยง3.1 Gap 1 (Production Deployment Patterns)

### Success Criteria

**Primary Success Metrics:**
1. **Pipeline Reliability:** >95% CI/CD pipeline success rate on clean branches (PRD-000 Goal 2)
2. **Feedback Speed:** <5 minutes from commit to build results (PRD-000 Goal 6)
3. **Standards Compliance:** >90% of PRs pass review without standards violations (PRD-000 Goal 5)
4. **Coverage Maintenance:** 100% of builds enforce >80% test coverage threshold

**User Satisfaction Metrics:**
1. Developer surveys confirm automated validation reduces anxiety about breaking builds
2. New team members report faster learning curve through automated feedback
3. Code review cycle time reduced (fewer review rounds due to automated quality checks)

## Functional Requirements (High-Level)

### Primary User Flow

**Happy Path: Developer Commits Code with Automated Validation**

1. **Developer commits code** to feature branch and pushes to remote repository
2. **System automatically detects** new commit and queues build job
3. **System notifies developer** that automated validation has started (GitHub notification, status check on PR)
4. **System executes validation suite** in parallel:
   - Code style and formatting checks
   - Type safety validation
   - Automated test execution with coverage reporting
   - Security vulnerability scanning
5. **System reports results** to developer within 5 minutes:
   - Build status (success/failure) displayed prominently on PR
   - Detailed logs available for failure investigation
   - Coverage report and metrics visible in build output
6. **Developer receives immediate feedback:**
   - If passing: Developer proceeds confidently to request code review
   - If failing: Developer investigates failures, fixes issues locally, commits again (loop to step 1)

**Alternative Flows:**

- **Alt Flow 1 (Pre-commit Prevention):** If developer attempts to commit code with obvious quality issues, pre-commit hooks run locally and block the commit, providing immediate feedback before push
- **Alt Flow 2 (Dependency Update Automation):** System automatically detects outdated dependencies or security vulnerabilities, creates automated pull request with dependency updates for team review
- **Alt Flow 3 (Main Branch Protection):** If developer attempts to push directly to main branch, system rejects push and reminds developer to use feature branch workflow

### User Interactions

**What the Developer Does:**
- Commits code to feature branch using standard Git workflow
- Pushes commits to remote repository triggering automated validation
- Reviews build status and results in GitHub interface
- Investigates failures using provided logs and error messages
- Fixes issues and commits again if validation fails
- Requests code review once automated validation passes

**What the Developer Does NOT Do (Automated by System):**
- Manually run linting or formatting tools before commit
- Manually execute test suite before push
- Manually check for type errors
- Manually verify test coverage thresholds
- Manually check for dependency vulnerabilities
- Manually deploy to testing environment for validation

### System Behaviors (User Perspective)

**What the System Does from User's Point of View:**
- **Detects changes instantly:** System monitors repository for new commits and triggers builds within 1 minute
- **Provides status visibility:** Build status is clearly visible on PR page with visual indicators (green checkmark = passing, red X = failing)
- **Runs checks automatically:** System executes comprehensive validation suite without requiring configuration or manual triggers
- **Reports results clearly:** Build results include actionable error messages, line numbers for failures, and links to detailed logs
- **Enforces quality gates:** System blocks PR merging if validation fails, ensuring main branch always contains passing code
- **Updates automatically:** System detects outdated dependencies and opens PRs for review, keeping project secure and current
- **Scales transparently:** System handles multiple developers committing simultaneously without queuing delays or conflicts

## Acceptance Criteria (High-Level)

### Criterion 1: Automated Pipeline Triggers on Every Commit

**Given** a developer has committed code to any feature branch
**When** the commit is pushed to the remote repository
**Then** the CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers within 1 minute without manual intervention
**And** the build status is visible on the GitHub PR page

### Criterion 2: Comprehensive Quality Checks Execute Automatically

**Given** the CI/CD pipeline has triggered for a new commit
**When** the pipeline executes validation suite
**Then** the system runs all quality checks in parallel:
- Code style and formatting validation
- Type safety checks
- Automated test execution with coverage reporting
- Security vulnerability scanning (if applicable)
**And** all checks complete within 5 minutes

### Criterion 3: Clear Build Results and Feedback

**Given** the CI/CD pipeline has completed validation
**When** a developer views the PR page
**Then** the build status is clearly displayed (success/failure with visual indicators)
**And** detailed failure information is available with actionable error messages
**And** coverage reports and metrics are accessible through build output
**And** developers can investigate failures without accessing external systems

### Criterion 4: Pre-commit Hooks Provide Early Feedback

**Given** a developer attempts to commit code with quality issues
**When** the commit command is executed
**Then** pre-commit hooks run locally and validate code quality
**And** commit is blocked if critical issues are detected (style violations, type errors)
**And** developer receives clear error messages with guidance for resolution

### Criterion 5: Dependency Management Automation

**Given** project dependencies have security vulnerabilities or are outdated
**When** the automated dependency scanning system detects issues
**Then** system automatically creates pull request with dependency updates
**And** PR includes summary of changes and rationale (security fix, version update)
**And** team can review and merge updates without manual dependency investigation

### Edge Cases & Error Conditions

- **Pipeline Infrastructure Failure:** If CI/CD infrastructure is unavailable, system displays clear error message and retries automatically. Developer is notified if issue persists beyond 10 minutes.
- **Flaky Test Failure:** If test fails intermittently, system provides indication of flakiness and allows developer to re-run pipeline without new commit.
- **Large Codebase Build Timeout:** If build exceeds 5-minute target due to large test suite, system provides progress indicators and completes build, flagging timeout issue for optimization.
- **Concurrent Commits from Multiple Developers:** System queues builds and executes in parallel, handling at least 10 concurrent builds without delays.

**Total Estimated Story Points:** ~21 SP
**Estimated Sprints:** 2-3 sprints (standard 2-week sprints with team of 2 engineers)

### Decomposition Strategy

**Strategy:** Decompose by pipeline stage and local vs. remote validation

**Rationale:**
- Stories 1-4 address remote CI/CD pipeline stages in logical execution order
- Story 5 addresses local pre-commit validation (can be parallelized with remote pipeline work)
- Story 6 addresses ongoing maintenance (dependency automation) as separate concern
- Each story delivers independently testable value (can validate each pipeline stage separately)
- Stories can be implemented in parallel by multiple engineers after story 1 establishes infrastructure

**Recommended Implementation Order:**
1. Story 1 (Pipeline Infrastructure) - **MUST complete first** to enable remaining stories
2. Stories 2-4 (Quality Checks, Type Validation, Testing) - Can be implemented in parallel
3. Story 5 (Pre-commit Hooks) - Can be implemented in parallel with stories 2-4
4. Story 6 (Dependency Management) - Implement last, after core pipeline proven stable

## Dependencies

### User Story Dependencies

- **Depends On:** HLS-001 (Development Environment Setup) - MUST be completed first
  - Developers need working local environments to test code before committing
  - Pre-commit hooks require local development environment setup
  - CI/CD pipeline depends on standardized repository structure and tooling established by HLS-001

- **Blocks:** HLS-003 (Application Skeleton Implementation), HLS-004 (Development Documentation & Workflow Standards)
  - Application skeleton implementation requires automated validation to ensure code quality from day one
  - Development workflow documentation references CI/CD pipeline and pre-commit hooks as core workflow components

### External Dependencies

- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD platform availability and capacity (organizational standard per PRD-000 Decision D2)
- **DockerHub:** Container registry access for base images and future container builds
- **HashiCorp Vault:** Secret management service for CI/CD credentials (organizational standard per PRD-000 Decision D2)
- **Renovate Bot:** Dependency automation service (third-party service hosted by organization)

## Non-Functional Requirements (User-Facing Only)

**Note:** Technical NFRs (performance targets, infrastructure architecture) are documented in PRD-000. Only user-facing NFRs included here.

- **Usability:**
  - Build status must be visible on PR page without navigating to external CI/CD system
  - Error messages must be actionable with specific line numbers and suggested fixes
  - Pre-commit hooks must provide clear guidance when blocking commits (not just cryptic error codes)
  - Developers with limited CI/CD experience should be able to interpret build failures without expert assistance

- **Accessibility:**
  - Build status indicators use both color and text/icons (not color alone) for accessibility
  - Error logs are readable by screen readers with proper formatting
  - Documentation includes visual workflow diagrams supplemented by detailed text descriptions

- **Performance (User-Perceived):**
  - Pipeline triggers within 1 minute of commit push (user expectation: near-instant)
  - Build results returned within 5 minutes (user expectation: fast feedback)
  - Pre-commit hooks complete within 10 seconds (user expectation: minimal friction)

- **Reliability (User-Perceived):**
  - Pipeline success rate >95% on clean branches (no flaky tests causing false failures)
  - Build infrastructure available 99.5% of time during business hours (minimal downtime)
  - Automated dependency PRs reviewed and merged within 1 business day (security responsiveness)

## Risks & Open Questions

### Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Flaky tests cause false failures** | High - reduces trust in automation, developers ignore failures | Enforce deterministic test design standards. Monitor test flakiness metrics. Quarantine flaky tests until fixed. Document flakiness prevention patterns. |
| **Pipeline execution time exceeds 5-minute target** | Medium - slows feedback loop, reduces developer satisfaction | Optimize test execution (parallel test running, test suite analysis). Monitor pipeline performance metrics. Set alerts for builds exceeding target. |
| **Pre-commit hooks too slow** | Medium - developers disable hooks to avoid friction | Keep pre-commit checks lightweight (fast linting only). Run comprehensive checks in CI/CD pipeline. Monitor pre-commit execution time. |
| **Dependency update PRs create noise** | Low - team ignores automated PRs, security vulnerabilities accumulate | Configure Renovate to batch minor updates weekly. Separate security updates (immediate) from version bumps (weekly). Establish review rotation for automated PRs. |
| **Build failures not actionable** | Medium - developers frustrated by cryptic errors, delays in fixing issues | Ensure error messages include line numbers, specific issues, and resolution guidance. Test error messages with new team members for clarity. |

### Decisions Made

**The following decisions were made during Product Owner review and resolve the high-level story uncertainties:**

**D1: Build Status Notifications**
- **Question:** Should build status notifications be sent to Slack/email in addition to GitHub UI, or is GitHub UI sufficient for developer awareness?
- **Decision:** For MVP - NO additional notifications (GitHub UI sufficient). Later stage - YES (add Slack/email notifications)
- **Rationale:** GitHub UI provides sufficient visibility for initial team size. Additional notification channels add complexity without proportional value at MVP stage. Can be added based on actual team feedback after initial deployment.

**D2: Manual Build Re-run Capability**
- **Question:** Do developers need ability to manually re-run failed builds without new commit, or is commit-triggered execution sufficient?
- **Decision:** For MVP - NO manual re-run capability (commit-triggered sufficient). Later stage - YES (add manual re-run capability)
- **Rationale:** Commit-triggered execution aligns with best practices (fix code, commit again). Manual re-runs primarily useful for transient infrastructure issues, which should be rare. Defer complexity until proven need emerges.

**D3: Pre-commit Hooks Enforcement**
- **Question:** Should pre-commit hooks be optional (developer choice) or mandatory (enforced by repository), or should there be different levels (basic vs. comprehensive)?
- **Decision:** Mandatory enforcement at repository level to ensure consistent standards compliance
- **Rationale:** Mandatory enforcement prevents standards drift and ensures uniform code quality across all contributors. Aligns with PRD-000 goal of >90% PRs passing review without standards violations. Developer autonomy preserved through --no-verify escape hatch for exceptional cases.

**D4: Build Queue Visibility**
- **Question:** What visibility should developers have into build queue status when multiple developers commit simultaneously?
- **Decision:** Build status tracking follows Git commit hash. Developers receive results for their specific commits only (no global queue visibility needed)
- **Rationale:** Per-commit tracking simplifies implementation and provides developers with the information they need (their commit status). Global queue visibility adds UI complexity without clear user value. GitHub Actions already handles queuing transparently.
