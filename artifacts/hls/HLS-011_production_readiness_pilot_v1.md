**User Persona Source:** PRD-006 §User Personas - Persona 1 (Enterprise Development Team Lead), Persona 2 (Framework Maintainer)

## User Story Statement

**As a** Framework Maintainer,
**I want** production-grade validation (performance benchmarking, security review, observability, stability monitoring) for MCP framework,
**So that** I can confidently expand to multiple pilot projects after 30-day stability period without risking disruption.

## User Context

### Target Persona
**Framework Maintainer (Alex) + Enterprise Development Team Lead (Sarah)**
- Alex validates MCP framework production readiness
- Sarah monitors pilot project stability and prepares for multi-project expansion

**User Characteristics:**
- Alex needs confidence that MCP framework meets production standards (performance, security, reliability)
- Sarah needs visibility into system health (observability dashboard)
- Both need 30-day stability period before expanding to additional projects (Decision D1)
- Pain point: Premature expansion could disrupt multiple projects if framework unstable

### User Journey Context
**Before this story:** MCP framework functionally complete (HLS-006 through HLS-010) but not production-validated. No observability, no performance benchmarks, no security hardening.

**After this story:** MCP framework production-ready with performance benchmarks meeting all NFRs, security hardened, observability dashboard operational, and 30-day stability period completed with zero high-severity bugs.

**Downstream impact:** Enables second pilot project expansion (Decision D1 - after 30-day stability period) and eventual enterprise rollout.

## Business Value

### User Value
- **Confidence:** Production validation reduces risk of framework instability disrupting projects
- **Visibility:** Observability dashboard enables proactive monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Security:** Security review and hardening protects against vulnerabilities
- **Predictability:** Performance benchmarks establish SLA baselines for future operations

### Business Value
- **Risk Mitigation:** 30-day stability period prevents costly multi-project disruption from immature framework
- **Enterprise Readiness:** Security and observability meet enterprise operational standards
- **Scalability Validation:** Performance benchmarks confirm ≥5 concurrent project support
- **Credibility:** Production-grade demonstration supports "production-ready infrastructure" positioning (per PRD-006 §Executive Summary)

### Success Criteria
- All success metrics from PRD-006 §Goals & Success Metrics met or exceeded
- Zero high-severity bugs from pilot project during 30-day stability period
- Documentation complete (migration guide, API reference, troubleshooting, deployment guide)
- Performance benchmarks meet all NFRs (availability, latency, scalability)

## Functional Requirements (High-Level)

### Primary User Flow (Performance Benchmarking)

**Happy Path:**
1. Alex runs performance benchmark suite against MCP framework
2. Benchmark tests resource loading latency (p95 target: <100ms)
3. Benchmark tests tool execution latency (p95 target: <500ms)
4. Benchmark tests Task Tracking API throughput (target: 100 RPS, p99 <200ms)
5. Benchmark tests ID management concurrency (50 concurrent requests, zero collisions)
6. Benchmark tests multi-project scalability (5 concurrent projects, <10% degradation)
7. Benchmark generates report: All NFR targets met
8. Alex archives benchmark report for SLA baseline

**Primary User Flow (Security Review):**
1. Alex reviews security checklist from PRD-006 (NFR-Security-01 through 04)
2. Alex validates Task Tracking API authentication (API key/JWT)
3. Alex validates MCP Server input validation (reject malformed requests)
4. Alex validates database credentials stored in environment variables (not hardcoded)
5. Alex validates rate limiting for ID reservation requests
6. Alex conducts penetration testing (basic security scan)
7. Alex remediates any vulnerabilities found
8. Security review complete - zero high/critical vulnerabilities

**Primary User Flow (Observability Dashboard):**
1. Alex deploys observability dashboard (Grafana or similar)
2. Dashboard displays: Resource cache hit rate, tool execution success rate, API latency percentiles, active projects count
3. Sarah monitors dashboard during pilot project
4. Dashboard alerts on anomalies (latency spikes, error rate increases)
5. Alex investigates alerts and optimizes as needed
6. Dashboard operational 24/7 throughout 30-day stability period

**Primary User Flow (30-Day Stability Period):**
1. Alex deploys production-ready MCP framework for AI Agent MCP Server project (self-hosting pilot)
2. Sarah and team use MCP framework for SDLC workflows
3. Alex monitors observability dashboard daily
4. Team logs any bugs/issues in issue tracker
5. Alex triages issues: high-severity (blocks work) vs. low-severity (enhancement)
6. 30 days elapse with zero high-severity bugs
7. Alex declares stability period successful
8. Product Manager approves second pilot project expansion

**Alternative Flows:**
- **Alt Flow 1: Performance Target Not Met:** If benchmark fails NFR target, optimize and re-test before declaring production-ready
- **Alt Flow 2: High-Severity Bug During Stability Period:** Reset 30-day clock after bug fixed and validated
- **Alt Flow 3: Security Vulnerability Found:** Remediate immediately, conduct follow-up scan

### User Interactions
- Alex runs performance benchmarks, reviews reports
- Alex conducts security review, remediates vulnerabilities
- Alex deploys and configures observability dashboard
- Sarah monitors dashboard during pilot project
- Team provides feedback on MCP framework usability and stability

### System Behaviors (User Perspective)
- Performance benchmark suite exercises all MCP components (resources, prompts, tools, microservice)
- Security scanning tools identify vulnerabilities automatically
- Observability dashboard aggregates metrics from MCP Server and Task Tracking microservice
- Dashboard alerts via email/Slack when metrics exceed thresholds
- System logs retained for 30+ days for troubleshooting

## Acceptance Criteria (High-Level)

### Criterion 1: Performance Benchmarks Meet All NFR Targets
**Given** performance benchmark suite executed
**When** results analyzed
**Then** all NFR-Performance targets met (resource loading <100ms p95, tool execution <500ms p95, API 100 RPS with p99 <200ms)

### Criterion 2: Multi-Project Scalability Validated
**Given** 5 concurrent projects using MCP framework
**When** scalability test executed
**Then** performance degradation <10% vs. single-project baseline, zero ID collisions, zero resource conflicts

### Criterion 3: Security Hardening Complete
**Given** security review checklist from PRD-006
**When** security validation performed
**Then** all security NFRs met, zero high/critical vulnerabilities found

### Criterion 4: Observability Dashboard Operational
**Given** observability dashboard deployed
**When** MCP framework in use
**Then** dashboard displays real-time metrics (cache hit rate, tool success rate, latency, active projects)

### Criterion 5: 30-Day Stability Period Completed
**Given** MCP framework deployed for AI Agent MCP Server project
**When** 30 days elapse
**Then** zero high-severity bugs reported, pilot project successful

### Criterion 6: Documentation Complete

**When** documentation reviewed
**Then** migration guide, API reference, troubleshooting guide, deployment guide complete

### Edge Cases & Error Conditions
- **Benchmark Failure:** If NFR target not met, identify bottleneck, optimize, re-test
- **High-Severity Bug During Stability Period:** Fix immediately, reset 30-day clock after validation
- **Dashboard Downtime:** Investigate alert system, ensure observability remains operational

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- Performance benchmarking (all NFR-Performance targets)
- Security review and hardening (all NFR-Security requirements)

### Out of Scope (Deferred to Future)
- Second pilot project expansion (after 30-day stability period per Decision D1)
- Open source release of Go microservices (Decision D2 - kept private for 3 months)
- Cloud-hosted database migration (containerized PostgreSQL sufficient for pilot per Decision D3)
- Horizontal scaling for Task Tracking microservice (future enhancement)
