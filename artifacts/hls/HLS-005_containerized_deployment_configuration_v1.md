## User Story Statement

**As a** software engineer deploying the AI Agent MCP Server to production or running it locally for development,
**I want** containerized deployment configuration with optimized production images and local development hot-reload support,
**So that** I can deploy to production confidently with consistent, reproducible environments and develop locally with fast iteration cycles, eliminating "works on my machine" issues.

## User Context

### Target Persona

**Primary:** Senior Backend Engineer (PRD-000 Persona 1)
- 5-10 years of experience building distributed systems
- Comfortable with container runtimes (Podman, Docker), Kubernetes deployment patterns
- Responsible for both local development and production deployment concerns
- Values efficient local development with hot-reload for rapid iteration
- Expects production deployment to be straightforward with minimal manual configuration
- Frustrated by manual deployment processes and environment inconsistency (per PRD-000 Problem Statement Pain Points 1 & 2)

**Secondary:** DevOps Engineer / Platform Engineer (Implied - not detailed in PRD-000)
- Responsible for production infrastructure and deployment pipelines
- Manages container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes in EPIC-005)
- Needs optimized container images following security best practices
- Values standardized deployment patterns enabling automation
- Requires database configuration for production environments

**User Characteristics:**
- Builds and deploys containers regularly (daily for development, weekly for staging/production)
- Expects container images to follow best practices (multi-stage builds, minimal size, non-root user)
- Needs hot-reload in local development to avoid container rebuilds during active coding
- Values consistent behavior between local development and production environments
- Expects database to run in container for local development (no native installation required per PRD-000 Decision D7)
- Uses unified CLI interface for container operations (`task container:build`, `task container:run`)

### User Journey Context

This story fits within the development and deployment lifecycle:
- **Before this story:** Developers run application directly with `python -m` commands, no production deployment path exists, database requires native installation creating environment inconsistency
- **This story enables:** Developers build production-ready container images, run application in containers locally with hot-reload, deploy to production using standard container runtime commands, run database in container for local development
- **After this story:** Application is production-deployable via containers, local development uses containerized dependencies for consistency, deployment process documented and validated

This story is foundational for production readiness (INIT-001 strategic objective) and enables future Kubernetes deployment in EPIC-005.

## Business Value

### User Value

**For Developers:**
- **Consistent Environments:** Container ensures application runs identically in local development, staging, and production (eliminates "works on my machine" failures)
- **Fast Local Iteration:** Hot-reload in local development enables code changes to apply without container rebuilds, maintaining development velocity
- **Simplified Database Setup:** Database runs in Podman container requiring no native PostgreSQL installation (reduces setup complexity per PRD-000 Decision D7)
- **Production Confidence:** Test production deployment locally before pushing to staging/production
- **Unified CLI Interface:** Container operations accessible through consistent `task` commands (`task container:build`, `task container:run`, `task db:start`)

**For DevOps Engineers:**
- **Standardized Deployment:** Container images follow best practices enabling automated deployment pipelines
- **Security Baseline:** Container configuration implements security best practices (non-root user, minimal base image) per PRD-000 NFR requirements
- **Clear Migration Path:** Database migration management provides clear path for schema changes in production

### Business Value

**Quantified Impact (per PRD-000 Goals & Success Metrics):**
- **Environment Consistency:** Eliminates "works on my machine" issues reducing debugging time by estimated 50% (per PRD-000 Problem Statement Pain Point 1)
- **Deployment Readiness:** Enables production deployment reducing time-to-production from weeks to days (supports INIT-001 KR2: <2 weeks time-to-production)
- **Onboarding Acceleration:** Containerized database eliminates native installation requirement reducing setup time component (contributes to PRD-000 Goal 4: <2 day onboarding)
- **Security Posture:** Production container follows security best practices reducing vulnerability risk

**Strategic Value:**
- Enables INIT-001 strategic objective: "Deploy agentic AI systems in weeks instead of months" by establishing production deployment path
- Positions project as reference architecture for enterprise MCP deployments by demonstrating production-ready containerization (addresses Business Research ยง3.1 Gap 1)
- Establishes foundation for Kubernetes deployment (EPIC-005) with optimized container images
- Reduces operational complexity through unified container architecture for application and dependencies

### Success Criteria

**Primary Success Metrics:**
1. **Container Build Success:** Container image builds successfully on first attempt without errors
2. **Production Deployment Validation:** Application runs successfully in production-like container environment (staging)
3. **Development Hot-Reload Performance:** Code changes reflect in running application within <2 seconds (PRD-000 NFR requirement)
4. **Environment Consistency:** Application behavior identical in local container and production deployment (no environment-specific bugs)

**User Satisfaction Metrics:**

## Functional Requirements (High-Level)

### Primary User Flow

**Happy Path: Developer Builds and Runs Application in Production Container**

1. **Developer completes application implementation** and prepares for production deployment testing
2. **Developer builds production container image** using unified CLI:
   - Executes `task container:build` command
   - System builds optimized multi-stage container image with Podman
   - Build completes in <5 minutes producing production-ready image
3. **Developer validates container image locally**:
   - Reviews build output confirming multi-stage build optimization
   - Verifies image size acceptable (target <500MB)
   - Confirms security scanning passes (no critical vulnerabilities)
4. **Developer runs application in production container**:
   - Executes `task container:run` command
   - Container starts successfully
   - Application serves requests on expected port
5. **Developer validates application behavior**:
   - Tests health check endpoint responds correctly
   - Validates application functionality matches local development behavior
   - Confirms no environment-specific issues
6. **Developer deploys to staging environment**:
   - Pushes container image to registry
   - Deploys using standard container runtime commands
   - Application runs successfully in staging (production-like environment)

**Alternative Flow A: Local Development with Hot-Reload**

1. **Developer starts local development session** in Devbox environment
2. **Developer starts development server** with hot-reload:
   - Executes `task dev` command within Devbox shell
   - Development server starts with hot-reload enabled
   - Application monitors code changes automatically
3. **Developer makes code change** and saves file
4. **System automatically reloads application**:
   - Detects file change within 1 second
   - Reloads application code without restart
   - Application ready within <2 seconds (PRD-000 NFR requirement)
5. **Developer tests change immediately** without manual restart or rebuild
6. **Developer iterates rapidly** maintaining development velocity

**Alternative Flow B: Local Database Setup with Container**

1. **Developer needs database** for local development or testing
2. **Developer starts database container**:
   - Executes `task db:start` command
   - System starts PostgreSQL + pgvector container using Podman
   - Container initializes database with default configuration
   - Database ready for connections within 10 seconds
3. **Developer runs application** connecting to containerized database
4. **Developer applies database migrations** (if needed):
   - Executes `task db:migrate` command
   - System applies migrations to development database
5. **Developer develops features** using containerized database
6. **Developer stops database** when finished:
   - Executes `task db:stop` command
   - Container shuts down cleanly

### User Interactions

**What the Developer Does:**
- Builds production container images using `task container:build` command
- Runs application in container using `task container:run` command
- Starts development server with hot-reload using `task dev` command
- Manages database container using `task db:*` commands
- Validates container behavior before deploying to staging/production
- Reviews container build output for optimization and security

**What the Developer Does NOT Do (Automated/Configured):**
- Manually write Containerfile with build stages (provided by foundation)
- Configure hot-reload manually (integrated in development setup)
- Install PostgreSQL natively (containerized per PRD-000 Decision D7)
- Manually configure database migrations (automated via task commands)
- Debug environment-specific issues (container ensures consistency)

### System Behaviors (User Perspective)

**What the Container Configuration Provides from User's Point of View:**
- **Optimized Production Image:** Multi-stage build produces minimal production image (<500MB typical)
- **Security Best Practices:** Container runs as non-root user, uses minimal base image
- **Fast Development Iteration:** Hot-reload applies code changes in <2 seconds
- **Database Container:** PostgreSQL + pgvector runs in Podman container with default configuration
- **Migration Management:** Database schema changes apply automatically via migration commands
- **Unified Interface:** All container operations accessible through consistent `task` commands
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Container configuration works with Podman (primary) and Docker (alternative)

## Acceptance Criteria (High-Level)

### Criterion 1: Production Container Image Builds Successfully

**Given** a developer has completed application implementation
**When** the developer executes `task container:build` command
**Then** container image builds successfully using multi-stage build
**And** final production image size is optimized (target <500MB)
**And** container follows security best practices (non-root user, minimal base image)
**And** build completes within 5 minutes

### Criterion 2: Application Runs Successfully in Production Container

**Given** a production container image has been built
**When** the developer executes `task container:run` command
**Then** application starts successfully in container
**And** health check endpoint responds correctly
**And** application behavior matches local development behavior
**And** application serves requests on expected port (8000)

### Criterion 3: Local Development Hot-Reload Functions

**Given** a developer is running development server via `task dev` in Devbox
**When** the developer modifies code and saves file
**Then** application detects change within 1 second
**And** application reloads automatically without manual restart
**And** application is ready to serve updated code within <2 seconds (PRD-000 NFR)
**And** developer can test changes immediately

### Criterion 4: Database Container Operational for Development

**Given** a developer needs database for local development

**And** no environment-specific bugs discovered (environment consistency achieved)

### Edge Cases & Error Conditions

- **Container Build Failure:** If container build fails, system provides actionable error message with specific build stage failure and resolution guidance
- **Port Conflict:** If application port already in use, container start fails with clear message suggesting port change or stopping conflicting process
- **Database Container Already Running:** If `task db:start` executed when database already running, command succeeds idempotently (no error, confirms database running)
- **Hot-Reload File Watcher Limitation:** If hot-reload fails to detect changes (rare filesystem issue), documentation provides fallback manual restart instructions
- **Podman Not Available:** If Podman not installed, commands provide clear error with installation instructions and Docker alternative guidance

## Non-Functional Requirements (User-Facing Only)

**Note:** Technical NFRs (infrastructure specifications, resource limits) are documented in PRD-000. Only user-facing NFRs included here.

- **Usability:**
  - Container operations accessible through intuitive `task` commands (no need to memorize complex Podman/Docker CLI options)
  - Hot-reload "just works" in local development without manual configuration
  - Database container starts with sensible defaults (no complex configuration required for development)
  - Error messages provide actionable guidance when container operations fail

  - Container image builds complete within 5 minutes
  - Hot-reload applies code changes within <2 seconds (PRD-000 NFR)
  - Database container ready for connections within 10 seconds
  - Container startup time <10 seconds (PRD-000 NFR for application startup)

- **Reliability (User-Perceived):**
  - Container build deterministic (same input produces identical image)
  - Hot-reload reliably detects file changes (no missed updates)
  - Database container stable for local development workloads
  - Container configuration validated in staging before production use

- **Portability:**
  - Container configuration works with Podman (primary) and Docker (alternative)
  - Container images portable across development machines and deployment environments
  - Database container configuration consistent across macOS, Linux, Windows WSL2

- **Security (Developer Awareness):**
  - Container runs as non-root user (developer understands security posture)
  - Container security scanning provides visibility into vulnerabilities
  - Database container uses secure defaults for development (no production credentials)

## Risks & Decisions Made

### Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Hot-reload too slow** | Medium - reduces development velocity, frustrates developers | Optimize file watcher configuration. Test with realistic codebase size. Document expected performance (<2 seconds target). Provide fallback manual restart if hot-reload insufficient. |
| **Container image size too large** | Medium - increases deployment time, registry storage costs | Implement multi-stage build. Use minimal base image (python:3.11-slim). Optimize dependency installation. Set target <500MB and monitor. |
| **Database container performance inadequate** | Medium - slows local development, developers request native installation | Test with realistic development workloads. Document acceptable performance per Decision D7. Provide configuration tuning guidance. Gather feedback during sprint to validate Decision D7 assumption. |
| **Podman compatibility issues** | Medium - blocks developers unfamiliar with Podman or on incompatible platforms | Provide explicit Docker alternative in documentation. Document Podman-specific considerations. Include troubleshooting for common Podman issues. Test on multiple platforms. |
| **Container security vulnerabilities** | High - production container has exploitable vulnerabilities | Implement container security scanning in CI/CD. Use regularly updated base images. Minimize installed packages. Follow security best practices. Monitor vulnerability reports. |
| **Hot-reload doesn't detect changes** | Medium - developer loses confidence in hot-reload, manually restarts frequently | Test file watcher on different filesystems. Document known limitations. Provide clear indication when reload occurs. Include troubleshooting guidance. |

### Decisions Made

**The following decisions were made during Product Owner review and resolve the high-level story uncertainties:**

**D1: Hot-Reload Default Behavior**
- **Question:** Should hot-reload be enabled by default in local development, or should developers opt-in via flag?
- **Decision:** Default to enabled for MVP (optimizes for convenience), document how to disable if issues encountered
- **Rationale:** Hot-reload optimizes developer experience by eliminating manual restart cycles, reducing context switching and improving feedback loops. Overhead is minimal with modern tooling. Default-enabled approach favors convenience for majority use case while providing opt-out documentation for edge cases where hot-reload causes issues. Can adjust based on team feedback during first sprint.

**D2: Database Container Data Persistence**
- **Question:** Should database container data persist between restarts, or reset to clean state each time?
- **Decision:** Implement persistence by default (maintains data), provide `task db:reset` command for clean state when needed
- **Rationale:** Persistence maintains development data across container restarts, avoiding loss of work-in-progress data and reducing friction when testing iterative changes. Schema migration issues are better addressed through proper migration framework (rollback capability) rather than frequent clean-slate resets. Explicit `task db:reset` command provides clean state when truly needed (e.g., testing fresh installation, clearing corrupted data) while defaulting to developer-friendly persistence.

**D3: Container Build Dependency Scope**
- **Question:** Should container build include development dependencies, or production-only?
- **Decision:** Production-only in container image (optimizes size per best practices), use Devbox for development workflows (already includes dev dependencies)
- **Rationale:** Container images should follow production best practices (minimal size, minimal attack surface) by including only runtime dependencies. Development dependencies (pytest, mypy, ruff, etc.) bloat image size without production value. Devbox already provides complete development environment with all dev dependencies for local workflows. This separation of concerns aligns with container best practices and reduces deployment costs (smaller images = faster pulls, lower registry storage).

**D4: Container Registry Authentication Strategy**
- **Question:** What container registry authentication approach for developers pushing images - shared credentials, individual accounts, or automated via CI/CD only?
- **Decision:** Automated via CI/CD for production deployments, individual developer accounts for staging environment testing
- **Rationale:** Production deployments must be automated via CI/CD for auditability, consistency, and security (no shared credentials). Individual developer accounts for staging enable developers to test containerized deployments before merging to main, providing validation of deployment configurations without production risk. This hybrid approach balances security (production) with flexibility (staging testing). Shared credentials explicitly rejected due to security and audit concerns.
