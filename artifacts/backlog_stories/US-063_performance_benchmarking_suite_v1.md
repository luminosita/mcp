## User Story
As a **Framework Maintainer**, I want **automated performance benchmarks validating all NFR-Performance targets** so that **I can establish SLA baselines and identify bottlenecks before pilot expansion**.

## Description

The MCP framework is functionally complete (HLS-006 through HLS-010) but lacks quantitative performance validation. Before expanding to second pilot project (per Decision D1 - 30-day stability period), we must establish performance baselines for:

1. **MCP Resource Loading** - Ensure SDLC pattern files, generators, templates load within <100ms p95
2. **MCP Tool Execution** - Validate `validate_artifact`, `resolve_artifact_path`, `store_artifact`, task tracking tools execute within <500ms p95
3. **Token Consumption** - Measure ≥40% reduction vs. local file approach baseline
4. **Task Tracking API** - Confirm 100 RPS throughput with p99 <200ms
5. **ID Management Concurrency** - Stress test with 50 concurrent ID reservations, verify zero collisions

This story delivers automated benchmark suite that runs against staging MCP Server deployment, generates performance reports with percentile latencies (p50, p95, p99), and flags failures when NFR targets not met.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§6.2: Prometheus Metrics Instrumentation** - Use `prometheus_client` Histogram metrics with buckets=[0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0] for latency tracking
  - **Example Code:** §6.2 shows `tool_duration_seconds.labels(tool_name=tool_name).observe(duration)` pattern for instrumentation
- **§7.2: Integration Testing with MCP Protocol** - Use MCP client to invoke tools programmatically and measure end-to-end latency
  - **Example Code:** §7.2 demonstrates `mcp_client.call_tool()` for automated tool invocation
- **§2.4: Cache Performance Testing** - Validate Redis cache hit rate >70% for resource loading per FR-20
  - **Performance Target:** First request 50ms (disk I/O), subsequent requests <10ms (cache hit)

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **§8.1 Pitfall 3: Poor Error Handling** - Benchmark failures must distinguish transient errors (retry) from persistent bottlenecks (investigation required)

**Performance Considerations:**
- **§2.2: FastAPI Async Performance** - Async I/O critical for achieving 100 RPS target; benchmark must confirm no synchronous blocking calls
- **§2.3: Database Connection Pooling** - Validate connection pool settings (pool_size=20, max_overflow=10) support concurrent load

## Functional Requirements
- Automated benchmark suite executable via CLI (`task benchmark`) or CI/CD pipeline
- Benchmarks for each NFR-Performance target (NFR-Performance-01 through 05)
- Generate JSON report with latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99), throughput (RPS), pass/fail status per NFR
- Baseline measurement mode for local file approach (capture pre-migration token usage)
- Comparison mode for MCP approach (measure token reduction vs. baseline)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Benchmark suite completes within 10 minutes (all tests, including stress tests)
- **Reliability:** Deterministic results - same infrastructure state produces <5% variance in measurements
- **Maintainability:** New benchmarks easily added via test framework plugin system
- **Observability:** Real-time progress updates during benchmark execution

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** Reference patterns-testing.md and patterns-tooling.md for implementation standards.

### Implementation Guidance

**Technology Stack:**
- **pytest-benchmark** - Python benchmarking framework with statistical analysis (ref: Implementation Research §7.1 - pytest recommended)
- **Locust** - Load testing framework for Task Tracking API throughput benchmarks
- **httpx AsyncClient** - Async HTTP client for MCP tool invocation latency tests
- **MCP Python SDK** - Client library for protocol-compliant tool calls

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- **patterns-tooling.md:** Use Taskfile command (`task benchmark`) to execute full suite, `task benchmark:resource` for specific benchmark category
- **patterns-testing.md:** Follow fixture patterns for MCP Server test instance, PostgreSQL test database, Redis test instance
- **patterns-typing.md:** Strict typing for BenchmarkResult Pydantic models (latency_p95: float, passed: bool, nfr_target: str)
- **patterns-validation.md:** Input validation for benchmark configuration (number of iterations, concurrency level, timeout thresholds)

**Note:** Treat patterns-*.md content as authoritative - supplement with story-specific benchmark implementation.

### Technical Tasks

**Backend Tasks:**
1. Implement benchmark harness with pytest-benchmark for latency measurements
2. Implement Locust test scenario for Task Tracking API load testing (100 RPS sustained for 60 seconds)
3. Create MCP resource loading benchmark (10 iterations × 15 resources, measure p95 latency)
4. Create MCP tool execution benchmark (validate_artifact, resolve_artifact_path, store_artifact, get_next_task, reserve_id_range)
5. Implement ID concurrency stress test (50 parallel goroutines requesting IDs, validate uniqueness)
6. Implement token consumption measurement (capture API telemetry for 10 representative workflows)
7. Generate JSON report with pass/fail per NFR target, detailed latency percentiles, recommendations for optimization

**Infrastructure Tasks:**
1. Deploy staging MCP Server with production-equivalent configuration
2. Deploy PostgreSQL test instance with realistic data volume (1000 tasks, 500 ID registry entries)
3. Deploy Redis cache instance for resource caching tests
4. Configure Prometheus metrics collection endpoint for benchmark instrumentation

**Documentation Tasks:**
1. Create benchmark execution runbook (setup, execution, result interpretation)
2. Document baseline establishment procedure for token consumption comparison

## Acceptance Criteria

## Implementation Tasks Evaluation

**Purpose:** Determine if this backlog story should be decomposed into separate Implementation Tasks (TASK-XXX artifacts) per SDLC Guideline v1.3 Section 11.

**Decision:** Tasks Needed

**Rationale:**
- **Story Points:** 8 SP (DON'T SKIP per decision matrix - complexity requires decomposition)
- **Developer Count:** Multiple developers (backend engineer for benchmarks, infrastructure engineer for staging deployment)
- **Domain Span:** Cross-domain (backend testing + infrastructure deployment + observability instrumentation)
- **Complexity:** High - requires load testing framework integration, statistical analysis, multi-service coordination
- **Uncertainty:** Medium - pytest-benchmark and Locust well-documented, but production-equivalent staging deployment may uncover configuration issues
- **Override Factors:**
  - **Cross-domain changes:** Backend (benchmark implementation) + Infrastructure (staging deployment) + Observability (Prometheus metrics)
  - **Performance-critical:** This story validates NFR-Performance targets; inaccurate measurements could lead to production issues
  - **Multiple system integrations:** MCP Server + Task Tracking microservice + PostgreSQL + Redis + Prometheus

**Proposed Implementation Tasks:**
- **TASK-012:** Implement pytest-benchmark harness and MCP resource loading benchmarks (8-12 hours)
  - Deliverables: Benchmark framework, resource loading latency tests, cache hit rate validation

  - Deliverables: Production-equivalent staging MCP Server, PostgreSQL, Redis, Prometheus metrics endpoint
- **TASK-018:** Implement benchmark report generation and CI/CD integration (4-6 hours)
  - Deliverables: JSON report formatter, GitHub Actions workflow, artifact upload

**Note:** TASK IDs (TASK-012 through TASK-018) follow sequential allocation after TASK-011 (from US-035).

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**Question 1:** Should benchmark suite run against containerized staging environment or locally-run MCP Server?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Containerized environment more production-realistic but adds deployment complexity; local run faster for iteration
- **Recommendation:** Use containerized staging for official benchmarks, support local mode for development iteration

**Question 2:** What statistical significance threshold should trigger benchmark failure (e.g., must NFR target be exceeded by 10% or 5%)?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Some variance expected due to hardware differences; overly strict thresholds cause false failures
- **Recommendation:** NFR target exceeded by >10% triggers FAIL, 5-10% triggers WARNING, <5% PASS

**Question 3:** Should token consumption measurement use live OpenAI API calls or mocked token counting?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES SPIKE]
- **Context:** Live API calls expensive and slow; mocked counting may not match real token usage accurately
- **Investigation Needed:** Benchmark mock token counting accuracy vs. OpenAI tiktoken library; validate <2% variance
- **Recommendation:** If variance <2%, use tiktoken library for fast, deterministic measurement; if >2%, use live API with small sample size

**Question 4:** How should benchmark handle transient infrastructure failures (network glitches, database connection timeouts)?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Transient failures during benchmark can produce false negatives; need retry strategy
- **Recommendation:** Implement exponential backoff retry (3 attempts max) for infrastructure operations; mark benchmark INCONCLUSIVE if >10% requests fail after retries
