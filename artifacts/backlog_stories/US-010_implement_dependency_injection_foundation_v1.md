## User Story
As a software engineer implementing MCP tools, I want a dependency injection system for accessing shared services (configuration, logging, database, external clients) so that I can build tools without managing service lifecycle or creating global state, enabling testable and maintainable tool implementations.

## Description
Implement FastAPI dependency injection infrastructure that enables MCP tools to access shared services through explicit injection rather than global variables. The system should support common service patterns (configuration, logging, database sessions, HTTP clients) while remaining simple, explicit, and easy to extend. Developer should understand how to add new dependencies by reviewing clear examples and documentation.

This story establishes the foundation for Story 3 (Example MCP Tool Implementation), which will demonstrate dependency injection usage patterns. All future tool implementations will rely on this dependency system to access shared infrastructure.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **ยง2.2: FastAPI Dependency Injection:** Sophisticated DI system for managing database sessions, auth context, and shared services
  - Leverages FastAPI's native `Depends()` mechanism for type-safe dependency resolution
  - Enables automatic cleanup via context managers and async generators
  - **Example Code:** Implementation Research ยง2.2 demonstrates FastAPI application with request-scoped dependencies
- **ยง2.6: Configuration Management (Pydantic Settings):** Environment-based configuration with type validation and secret management
  - Use `pydantic-settings` for environment variable loading with type coercion
  - Support `.env` files for local development, environment variables for production
  - Validate configuration at startup to fail fast with clear errors
- **ยง3.1: Overall Architecture Pattern:** Application follows microservices principles with clear separation of concerns
  - Dependency injection enables modularity: new tools can access services without modifying core code
  - Services registered in `core/dependencies.py` module for centralized management

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **Avoid Global State:** Do not use module-level singletons or global variables for services (difficult to test, unclear lifecycle)
- **Avoid "Magic" DI Frameworks:** Use FastAPI's explicit `Depends()` mechanism rather than decorator-based auto-wiring (maintains clarity)
- **Avoid Tight Coupling:** Services should depend on abstractions (protocols/interfaces) when possible, not concrete implementations

**Performance Considerations:**
- **Dependency Resolution Overhead:** FastAPI caches dependency resolution results within request scope (negligible overhead)
- **Database Connection Pooling:** Use SQLAlchemy async engine with connection pool (configured in US-009 configuration)
- **HTTP Client Reuse:** Create single `httpx.AsyncClient` instance at app startup, share across requests via dependency injection (avoid per-request client creation overhead)

## Functional Requirements
- Configure FastAPI dependency injection system for common service patterns
- Provide dependency providers for:
  - Application settings (configuration singleton)
  - Structured logger instances (per-request or per-service loggers)
  - Database sessions (async SQLAlchemy sessions with automatic cleanup)
  - HTTP client instances (shared async HTTP client with connection pooling)
- Enable MCP tools to declare dependencies via FastAPI `Depends()` mechanism
- Document clear process for adding new dependency providers
- Demonstrate dependency injection with at least one example service accessible to tools

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Usability:**
  - Adding new dependency provider requires <10 lines of code following established pattern
  - Developer can understand how to inject dependencies into tool by reviewing 2-3 example functions
  - Error messages for missing dependencies are actionable (indicate which service failed to initialize and why)
- **Performance:**
  - Dependency resolution adds <5ms overhead per tool invocation (FastAPI caching ensures minimal overhead)
  - Database connection pool configured for high concurrency (10-20 connections typical, configurable via settings)
- **Maintainability (Developer Perspective):**
  - All dependency providers centralized in `core/dependencies.py` module for easy discovery
  - Dependencies use type hints enabling IDE autocomplete and static analysis
  - Each dependency provider includes docstring explaining purpose and lifecycle (request-scoped vs. application-scoped)
- **Testability:**
  - Dependencies can be overridden in tests using FastAPI's `app.dependency_overrides` mechanism
  - Mock implementations easily substituted without modifying application code
  - Unit tests can inject mock dependencies directly into functions without FastAPI app context

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** This story implements technical patterns aligned with specialized CLAUDE-*.md implementation standards. Technical guidance below supplements (does not duplicate) these standards.

### Implementation Guidance

**Dependency Providers Architecture:**

Create `src/mcp_server/core/dependencies.py` module containing:
- **Settings Dependency:** Return cached `Settings` instance (application-scoped singleton)
- **Logger Dependency:** Return structured logger instance with request context
- **Database Session Dependency:** Async generator yielding SQLAlchemy `AsyncSession`, automatically closes after request
- **HTTP Client Dependency:** Return shared `httpx.AsyncClient` instance (created at app startup, closed at shutdown)

**Application Lifespan Management:**

Use FastAPI lifespan context manager (`@asynccontextmanager`) for startup/shutdown logic:
- Startup: Initialize shared HTTP client, validate database connectivity, log application start
- Shutdown: Close HTTP client, close database engine, log graceful shutdown

**Dependency Injection Patterns:**

Follow FastAPI `Depends()` pattern for all dependency injection:
```python
from fastapi import Depends
from typing import Annotated

# Type alias for injected dependencies (improves readability)
SettingsDep = Annotated[Settings, Depends(get_settings)]
LoggerDep = Annotated[logging.Logger, Depends(get_logger)]
SessionDep = Annotated[AsyncSession, Depends(get_db_session)]
```

MCP tools can then declare dependencies in function signatures:
```python
async def some_tool(
    params: ToolInput,
    settings: SettingsDep,
    logger: LoggerDep,
    session: SessionDep,
) -> ToolOutput:
    logger.info("Tool invoked", extra={"tool": "some_tool"})
    # Tool implementation using injected dependencies
```

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- **CLAUDE-architecture.md:** Follow dependency injection pattern (lines 380-436) demonstrating FastAPI `Depends()` usage, async session management, and service provider functions
- **CLAUDE-typing.md:** Use `Annotated` type hints for dependency injection (modern Python 3.9+ syntax), enabling clear type documentation and IDE support
- **CLAUDE-validation.md:** Use Pydantic Settings for configuration validation, ensuring type-safe environment variable loading with clear validation errors at startup
- **CLAUDE-core.md:** Follow core development philosophy (KISS, explicit over implicit), avoiding "magic" dependency resolution in favor of clear FastAPI `Depends()` declarations

**Note:** Treat CLAUDE.md content as authoritative - supplement with story-specific context, don't duplicate.

### Technical Tasks
- Create `core/dependencies.py` module with dependency provider functions
- Implement `get_settings()` dependency returning singleton `Settings` instance
- Implement `get_logger()` dependency returning configured logger with structured logging support
- Implement `get_db_session()` async generator yielding database session with automatic cleanup
- Implement `get_http_client()` dependency returning shared HTTP client instance
- Update `main.py` with lifespan context manager for HTTP client and database initialization
- Create type aliases for common dependencies using `Annotated` syntax (improves ergonomics)
- Document dependency injection process in inline docstrings and architecture comments
- Add example usage demonstrating how to inject dependencies into functions

## Acceptance Criteria

**Format Guidance:** Gherkin format (Given-When-Then) for scenario-based validation

### Scenario 1: Settings Dependency Injection
**Given** the FastAPI application has started successfully
**When** a function declares dependency on `Settings` using `Depends(get_settings)`
**Then** the function receives the singleton `Settings` instance populated from environment variables
**And** the settings instance contains validated configuration (app_name, database_url, etc.)
**And** calling `get_settings()` multiple times returns the same instance (singleton pattern)

### Scenario 2: Logger Dependency Injection
**Given** the FastAPI application has started successfully
**When** a function declares dependency on `Logger` using `Depends(get_logger)`
**Then** the function receives a configured logger instance with structured logging support
**And** log messages include contextual information (timestamp, log level, module name)
**And** logger can write to configured output (stdout for development, file/service for production)

### Scenario 3: Database Session Dependency Injection
**Given** the FastAPI application has connected to database successfully
**When** a function declares dependency on `AsyncSession` using `Depends(get_db_session)`
**Then** the function receives an active SQLAlchemy `AsyncSession` instance
**And** the session is automatically closed after the function completes (including error cases)
**And** database connections are reused from connection pool (no new connection per request)
**And** session supports async/await patterns for database operations

### Scenario 4: HTTP Client Dependency Injection
**Given** the FastAPI application has initialized shared HTTP client at startup
**When** a function declares dependency on `httpx.AsyncClient` using `Depends(get_http_client)`
**Then** the function receives the shared HTTP client instance with connection pooling
**And** HTTP client reuses connections for external API calls (connection pooling active)
**And** HTTP client is properly closed during application shutdown

### Scenario 5: Dependency Documentation and Discoverability
**Given** a developer needs to understand how to inject dependencies into a new MCP tool
**When** the developer reviews `core/dependencies.py` module and example usage
**Then** developer can identify available dependency providers (settings, logger, session, HTTP client)
**And** each dependency provider includes docstring explaining purpose and lifecycle
**And** example code demonstrates how to declare dependencies in function signatures using `Depends()`
**And** developer can add new dependency provider by following established pattern (<10 lines of code)

### Scenario 6: Application Lifespan Management
**Given** the FastAPI application is starting up
**When** the lifespan context manager executes startup logic
**Then** shared HTTP client is initialized successfully
**And** database connectivity is validated (connection test executes without error)
**And** application logs "Application started" with version information

**Given** the FastAPI application is shutting down gracefully
**When** the lifespan context manager executes shutdown logic
**Then** HTTP client connections are closed properly
**And** database engine is disposed (all connections returned to pool)
**And** application logs "Application shutdown complete"

### Scenario 7: Dependency Override for Testing
**Given** a developer is writing unit tests for a function with injected dependencies
**When** the developer uses FastAPI's `app.dependency_overrides` mechanism
**Then** the developer can substitute mock implementations for real dependencies
**And** tests can run without requiring actual database or external services
**And** mock dependencies are called with expected parameters during test execution
