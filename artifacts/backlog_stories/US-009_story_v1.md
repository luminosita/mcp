## User Story

As a software engineer implementing new MCP tools for the AI Agent server, I want a working FastAPI application skeleton with health check endpoint, so that I can start implementing tools with proper project structure and minimal configuration overhead.

## Description

This story establishes the foundational FastAPI application structure for the MCP server project. It creates the application entry point, configures Pydantic-based settings management, implements a health check endpoint for operational monitoring, and establishes the Python src layout that all subsequent features will build upon.

The health check endpoint will return system status information including application version, dependency health, and uptime, enabling monitoring tools to verify server availability and diagnose issues.

This is the first story in HLS-003 and is a prerequisite for all other stories in the high-level story. No feature development can proceed until this foundational structure is in place.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§2.1: Python 3.11+ Technology Stack:** Use Python 3.11+ with modern type hints for static analysis and developer ergonomics
  - Type hints required for all function signatures
  - Async/await patterns for I/O-bound operations
- **§2.2: FastAPI Framework:** FastAPI 0.100+ provides Pydantic integration, automatic documentation, and high-performance async capabilities
  - Example Code: Implementation Research §2.2 lines 107-150 (FastAPI server setup with CORS, health endpoint)
- **§6.1: Structured Logging:** Implement structured logging with JSON output for operational visibility
  - Example Code: Implementation Research §6.1 lines 772-808 (structlog configuration)

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **§8.1: Treating MCP as Stateless REST:** Avoid treating MCP connections as simple REST endpoints. Use FastMCP SDK which handles lifecycle automatically (deferred to US-011 when example tool implementation begins)
- **§8.2: Synchronous Blocking Calls in Async Context:** Use async libraries (httpx, asyncpg) instead of synchronous alternatives (requests, psycopg2) to avoid blocking event loop

**Performance Considerations:**
- **§2.2: Async Performance:** FastAPI built on Starlette and Uvicorn provides high-performance async I/O suitable for thousands of concurrent connections

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-1:** FastAPI application entry point at `src/main.py` with proper ASGI application initialization
- **FR-2:** Configuration management using Pydantic `BaseSettings` model loading from environment variables
- **FR-3:** Health check endpoint at `/health` returning JSON response with system status
- **FR-4:** Application follows Python src layout with clear separation of concerns (src/, tests/, docs/)
- **FR-5:** Server starts successfully with minimal configuration using `uvicorn`
- **FR-6:** Application can be started via Taskfile command (`task dev`)

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
  - Application startup time: <10 seconds (PRD-000 NFR)
  - Health check response time: <50ms at p95 (simple status check, no external dependencies)

- **Reliability:**
  - Health check endpoint must return 200 OK when application is operational
  - Configuration validation must fail fast on startup if required environment variables missing

- **Maintainability:**
  - Code structure must follow Python src layout per CLAUDE-architecture.md
  - All code must include type hints for static analysis per CLAUDE-typing.md
  - Configuration model must be extensible (easy to add new settings as features develop)

- **Usability (Developer Perspective):**
  - Application structure follows "principle of least surprise" (conventional FastAPI patterns)
  - Configuration errors must provide actionable error messages with specific guidance
  - Health check output must be human-readable JSON (for manual debugging) and machine-parseable (for monitoring tools)

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** Reference established implementation standards from specialized CLAUDE.md files. Supplement with story-specific technical guidance.

### Implementation Guidance

**Application Structure:**
- Entry point: `src/main.py` creates FastAPI application instance
- Configuration: `src/config.py` defines Pydantic settings model
- Core: `src/core/constants.py` defines application constants (version, name)
- Follow Python src layout per CLAUDE-architecture.md

**Health Check Implementation:**
- Endpoint path: `GET /health`
- Response schema: JSON with fields `status`, `version`, `uptime_seconds`, `timestamp`
- Status values: `healthy` (all systems operational), `degraded` (partial functionality), `unhealthy` (critical failure)
- For this MVP story: Always return `healthy` (dependency checks deferred to future stories when external services integrated)

**Configuration Management:**
- Use Pydantic `BaseSettings` model per Implementation Research §2.3 lines 557-579
- Load from environment variables with sensible defaults
- Include: `APP_NAME`, `APP_VERSION`, `DEBUG`, `HOST`, `PORT`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_FORMAT`
- Validate on application startup (fail fast with clear error messages)
- Use `.env` file for local development (per PRD-000 User Flow 1)

**Logging:**
- Structured logging with JSON output per Implementation Research §6.1
- Use `structlog` library for structured logging capabilities
- Log levels: DEBUG (development), INFO (production default), WARNING, ERROR
- Initial implementation: Basic console logging (advanced observability deferred to EPIC-004 per PRD-000 Decision D6)

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- **CLAUDE-tooling.md:** Use Taskfile command `task dev` to start development server with hot-reload
- **CLAUDE-typing.md:** Apply type hints to all functions (strict mode, Pydantic models for configuration per CLAUDE-validation.md)
- **CLAUDE-validation.md:** Use Pydantic `BaseSettings` for configuration validation with clear error messages
- **CLAUDE-architecture.md:** Follow Python src layout with clear module separation (main.py, config.py, core/)
- **CLAUDE-testing.md:** Write unit tests for configuration validation and health check endpoint (covered in testing strategy)

**Note:** Treat CLAUDE.md content as authoritative - supplement with story-specific context, don't duplicate.

### Technical Tasks

**Backend Tasks:**
1. Create `src/main.py` with FastAPI application initialization
2. Create `src/config.py` with Pydantic settings model (BaseSettings)
3. Create `src/core/constants.py` with application constants (VERSION, APP_NAME)
4. Implement `/health` endpoint returning status JSON
5. Configure structured logging with structlog (JSON output)
6. Add startup event handler to log application start
7. Configure CORS middleware for development (allow localhost origins)

**Development Tooling Tasks:**
1. Update `Taskfile.yml` with `task dev` command to start uvicorn server
2. Create `.env.example` with configuration template
3. Update `pyproject.toml` with dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn[standard], pydantic, pydantic-settings, structlog)

**Documentation Tasks:**
1. Add quickstart section to README.md showing `task dev` usage
2. Document configuration environment variables in README.md
3. Add docstrings to main.py and config.py explaining architecture patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Successful application startup with default configuration
**Given** a developer has completed environment setup (HLS-001) and entered Devbox shell
**When** the developer runs `task dev` from project root
**Then** the FastAPI application starts successfully without errors
**And** the console displays startup log showing application name, version, and listening address
**And** the server listens on http://localhost:8000 (default)

### Scenario 2: Health check endpoint returns valid response
**Given** the FastAPI application is running locally
**When** the developer makes a GET request to http://localhost:8000/health
**Then** the endpoint returns HTTP 200 OK status
**And** the response body is valid JSON
**And** the JSON includes fields: `status` (value: "healthy"), `version` (matches APP_VERSION), `uptime_seconds` (positive number), `timestamp` (ISO 8601 format)
**And** response time is <50ms (measured via curl)

### Scenario 3: Configuration validation fails fast on invalid settings
**Given** the `.env` file contains invalid PORT value (e.g., PORT="invalid")
**When** the developer runs `task dev`
**Then** the application fails to start
**And** the error message clearly identifies the configuration issue: "Invalid PORT configuration: value is not a valid integer"
**And** the application exits with non-zero status code

### Scenario 4: Application uses custom configuration from environment
**Given** the `.env` file contains custom settings (PORT=8080, LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG, APP_NAME="CustomMCP")
**When** the developer runs `task dev`
**Then** the application starts on http://localhost:8080 (custom port)
**And** the startup log shows APP_NAME="CustomMCP"
**And** DEBUG-level log messages are visible in console

### Scenario 5: Automatic API documentation is available
**Given** the FastAPI application is running locally
**When** the developer navigates to http://localhost:8000/docs in browser
**Then** the Swagger UI documentation page loads successfully
**And** the documentation lists the `/health` endpoint with description
**And** the developer can execute test requests via "Try it out" button

### Scenario 6: Structured logging outputs JSON format
**Given** the `.env` file contains LOG_FORMAT=json
**When** the developer runs `task dev` and makes request to `/health`
**Then** log output is valid JSON (one JSON object per line)
**And** each log entry includes fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `request_id` (if applicable)

## Additional Information

**Suggested Labels:** foundation, fastapi, backend, infrastructure, critical-path

**Estimated Story Points:** 3 (per HLS-003 decomposition)

**Estimation Rationale:**
- Straightforward FastAPI setup following established patterns
- Configuration with Pydantic is well-documented
- Health check endpoint is simple (no external dependencies)
- Most complexity in proper project structure setup
- No external service integration (per HLS-003 Decision D1)
- Estimated 1 day of development + 0.5 day for testing/documentation

**Dependencies:**
- **Depends On:** HLS-001 (Development Environment Setup) - MUST be completed first
  - Requires working development environment with Python 3.11+, uv, Taskfile
  - Devbox isolated environment must be configured
  - Repository structure established
- **Depends On:** HLS-002 (CI/CD Pipeline Setup) - SHOULD be completed first
  - Enables automated validation of code quality (linting, type checking, tests)
  - Not blocking: can proceed without CI/CD, but manual validation required
- **Blocks:** US-010 (Dependency Injection Foundation) - Cannot start until this story complete
- **Blocks:** US-011 (Example MCP Tool Implementation) - Requires application structure
- **Blocks:** US-012 (Test Suite for Example Tool) - Requires working application
- **Blocks:** US-013 (Application Architecture Documentation) - Documents this structure

**Related Stories:**
- US-010: Dependency Injection Foundation (immediate next story)
- US-011: Example MCP Tool Implementation (requires US-009 + US-010)
- US-012: Test Suite for Example Tool (parallel with US-011)
- US-013: Application Architecture Documentation (final story, documents all patterns)

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**Note:** Backlog Story Open Questions capture implementation uncertainties needing resolution during sprint execution.

**No open implementation questions.** All technical approaches are well-defined:
- FastAPI setup follows standard patterns from Implementation Research §2.2
- Configuration management uses Pydantic BaseSettings (well-documented pattern)
- Health check implementation is straightforward (no external dependencies per HLS-003 Decision D1)
- Structured logging follows Implementation Research §6.1 patterns
- All patterns documented in specialized CLAUDE.md files (CLAUDE-architecture.md, CLAUDE-typing.md, CLAUDE-validation.md, CLAUDE-tooling.md)

**If uncertainties arise during implementation, mark with appropriate tags:**
- [REQUIRES SPIKE] - Time-boxed investigation needed (1-3 days)
- [REQUIRES TECH LEAD] - Senior technical input needed
- [CLARIFY BEFORE START] - Must resolve before beginning task
