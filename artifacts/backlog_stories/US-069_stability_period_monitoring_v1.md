## User Story
As a **Framework Maintainer**, I want **structured daily monitoring and feedback collection during 30-day stability period** so that **I can identify and resolve high-severity bugs before second pilot expansion**.

## Description

Per Decision D1, MCP framework requires 30-day stability period after initial deployment to AI Agent MCP Server project (self-hosting pilot) before expanding to second pilot project. This story defines monitoring procedures, feedback collection, and issue triage during validation period.

**Stability Period Goal:** Zero high-severity bugs (blocks work) over 30 consecutive days. If high-severity bug discovered, clock resets after bug fixed and validated.

**Daily Monitoring Activities:**
1. **Dashboard Review** - Check Grafana observability dashboard for anomalies (latency spikes, error rate increases, cache performance degradation)
2. **Log Review** - Review structured logs for errors, warnings, security events
3. **User Feedback Collection** - Daily check-in with pilot project team (async via Slack or 15-minute standup)
4. **Issue Triage** - Categorize reported issues as high-severity (blocks work) or low-severity (enhancement)
5. **Metric Tracking** - Record daily stability metrics (uptime, error count, performance targets met)

**Success Criteria:**
- **Zero high-severity bugs** - No issues blocking pilot project work
- **SLA targets met** - All NFR-Performance and NFR-Availability targets maintained
- **User satisfaction** - Pilot project team reports framework usability acceptable
- **Documentation validated** - Migration guide, API reference, deployment guide tested during pilot

**Issue Severity Classification:**
- **High-Severity:** Blocks pilot project work (system unavailable, data corruption, authentication failures, critical performance degradation >50%)
- **Low-Severity:** Enhancement request, minor inconvenience (slow performance <50% degradation, cosmetic issues, missing non-critical features)

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§6.1: Structured Logging** - Review structured JSON logs for error patterns using jq or log aggregation tool
  - **Example:** `cat logs/mcp-server.log | jq 'select(.level=="error")' | less`
- **§6.2: Prometheus Metrics** - Query Prometheus for daily metric summaries (uptime, error rate, latency percentiles)
  - **Example:** Grafana dashboard query: `avg_over_time(mcp_tool_duration_seconds{quantile="0.95"}[24h])`
- **§6.3: Distributed Tracing** - Use OpenTelemetry traces to debug performance issues reported by pilot team

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **Ignoring Low-Severity Issues:** Low-severity bugs tracked for post-pilot improvement but don't block expansion

**Performance Considerations:**
- N/A (operational monitoring story)

## Functional Requirements
- Daily monitoring checklist (30 days):
  - [ ] Review Grafana dashboard (cache hit rate, tool success rate, latency, active projects)
  - [ ] Review error logs (jq filter for level="error")
  - [ ] Check-in with pilot project team (async Slack message or 15-minute standup)
  - [ ] Triage new issues reported (high-severity vs. low-severity)
  - [ ] Record daily metrics (uptime %, error count, p95 latency, SLA compliance)
- Weekly summary report:
  - Week X summary (Days 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, 29-30)
  - Issues discovered (high-severity count, low-severity count)
  - Metrics trend (uptime, error rate, latency trend)
  - User feedback summary
  - Remediation actions taken
- Stability period completion report:
  - 30-day metrics summary (uptime, error rate, latency, SLA compliance)
  - Total issues discovered (high-severity count, low-severity count, all resolved)
  - Lessons learned (framework improvements identified)
  - Recommendation: Approve second pilot expansion or extend stability period

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Reliability:** Framework uptime >99.5% over 30-day period
- **Performance:** All NFR-Performance targets met (p95 latencies, throughput)
- **Availability:** Zero downtime incidents lasting >5 minutes
- **Issue Response Time:** High-severity issues acknowledged within 4 hours, resolved within 24 hours

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** Reference patterns-tooling.md for log review commands.

### Implementation Guidance

**Monitoring Tools:**
- **Grafana Dashboard** - Visual monitoring for metrics (deployed in US-066)
- **jq** - Command-line JSON processor for log filtering
- **Prometheus CLI** - Query Prometheus for metric trends (optional)
- **Slack** - Async communication with pilot team for feedback collection
- **Google Sheets or Notion** - Daily monitoring log (date, uptime, error count, issues, actions)

**Daily Monitoring Routine (15-20 minutes/day):**
1. Open Grafana dashboard, check for red/yellow indicators (5 minutes)
2. Review error logs: `cat logs/mcp-server.log | jq 'select(.level=="error" or .level=="warning")' | tail -50` (5 minutes)
3. Post async check-in to Slack: "Daily MCP Framework Check-in: Any issues or feedback today?" (2 minutes)
4. Record metrics in daily log: uptime %, error count, p95 latency (3 minutes)
5. Triage new issues if reported (5 minutes or escalate if complex)

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- **patterns-tooling.md:** Use Taskfile command (`task logs:errors`) to filter error logs, `task metrics:summary` for daily metrics

**Note:** Treat patterns-*.md content as authoritative - supplement with story-specific monitoring procedures.

### Technical Tasks

**Monitoring Setup Tasks:**
1. Create daily monitoring checklist template (Google Sheets or Notion)
2. Configure Slack channel for pilot project feedback (#mcp-framework-pilot)
3. Set up jq filters for common log queries (errors, warnings, security events)
4. Create Taskfile commands for monitoring (`task logs:errors`, `task metrics:summary`)

**Daily Monitoring Tasks (30 days):**
1. Review Grafana dashboard daily (cache hit rate, tool success rate, latency, active projects)
2. Review error logs daily (jq filter for errors/warnings)
3. Post async check-in to Slack daily
4. Triage new issues reported (high-severity vs. low-severity)
5. Record metrics in daily log (uptime, error count, latency, SLA compliance)

**Weekly Reporting Tasks:**
1. Generate weekly summary report (Days 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, 29-30)
2. Aggregate weekly metrics (average uptime, total errors, latency trend)
3. Summarize user feedback (common themes, pain points, positive feedback)
4. Document remediation actions taken (bugs fixed, optimizations applied)

**Completion Tasks:**
1. Generate 30-day stability period completion report
2. Calculate aggregate metrics (30-day uptime, total issues, all resolved)
3. Document lessons learned (framework improvements for post-pilot iteration)
4. Present recommendation to Product Manager (approve second pilot expansion or extend period)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Daily Monitoring Checklist Completion
**Given** 30-day stability period underway (Day 5 example)
**When** Framework maintainer performs daily monitoring
**Then** Daily checklist completed:
  - [x] Grafana dashboard reviewed (no red indicators, latency within targets)
  - [x] Error logs reviewed (zero critical errors, 3 warnings logged and triaged)
  - [x] Slack check-in posted ("Daily Check-in Day 5: Any issues or feedback?")
  - [x] Metrics recorded (uptime: 100%, error count: 0, p95 latency: 85ms)
  - [x] Issues triaged (1 low-severity issue reported: "Validation error message unclear" - logged for future improvement)

### Scenario 2: High-Severity Bug Detection and Clock Reset
**Given** Stability period at Day 15 with zero high-severity bugs
**When** Pilot team reports high-severity bug: "Task Tracking API returns 500 error intermittently"
**Then** High-severity issue logged and prioritized for immediate resolution
**And** Issue acknowledged within 4 hours, root cause identified (database connection timeout)
**And** Fix deployed and validated within 24 hours
**And** Stability period clock resets to Day 0 (restart 30-day count from fix deployment date)
**And** Incident documented in weekly report (root cause, fix, impact)

### Scenario 3: Weekly Summary Report Generation
**Given** Week 1 completed (Days 1-7)
**When** Framework maintainer generates weekly summary report
**Then** Report includes:
  - **Week 1 Summary (Days 1-7)**
  - **Metrics:** Average uptime 99.8%, total errors 0, average p95 latency 82ms
  - **Issues:** 0 high-severity, 3 low-severity (logged for future improvement)
  - **User Feedback:** Pilot team reports "Framework usable, migration guide helpful, minor confusion with API authentication"
  - **Remediation Actions:** Updated API documentation to clarify authentication (1 hour fix)

### Scenario 4: Low-Severity Issue Triage (No Clock Reset)
**Given** Stability period at Day 20 with zero high-severity bugs
**When** Pilot team reports low-severity issue: "Cache hit rate 65%, slightly below 70% target"
**Then** Low-severity issue logged for post-pilot optimization (not blocking work)
**And** Issue does NOT reset stability period clock (low-severity tolerated)
**And** Issue documented in weekly report for tracking
**And** Pilot project continues without interruption

### Scenario 5: SLA Compliance Verification
**Given** NFR-Performance-01 target: p95 resource loading latency <100ms
**When** Daily metrics recorded over 30 days
**Then** 100% of daily measurements meet target (p95 latency ≤ 100ms)
**And** Any day exceeding target investigated (logs, dashboard review)
**And** SLA compliance status recorded in daily log (Pass/Fail per NFR)

### Scenario 6: User Feedback Collection (Async Slack Check-in)
**Given** Daily Slack check-in posted: "Day 12 Check-in: Any issues or feedback?"
**When** Pilot team responds within 24 hours
**Then** Feedback recorded in daily log:
  - **Positive:** "Generator prompts working well, artifact validation helpful"
  - **Issue:** "Occasional latency spike when loading large PRDs (>50KB)" (low-severity)
  - **Question:** "Can we add custom validation rules?" (enhancement request)
**And** Feedback themes tracked across 30 days for post-pilot improvements

  - **Total Issues:** 0 high-severity, 12 low-severity (all logged for future improvement)
  - **Lessons Learned:** 5 framework improvements identified (caching optimization, API documentation clarity, validation error messages, etc.)
  - **Recommendation:** ✅ Approve second pilot project expansion (stability period successful, zero high-severity bugs)
**And** Product Manager approves second pilot expansion

### Scenario 8: Stability Period Extension (Alternative Path)
**Given** Day 28 completed but 2 high-severity bugs discovered and fixed during period (clock resets)
**When** Framework maintainer evaluates stability status
**Then** Stability period NOT completed (only 2 consecutive bug-free days, not 30)
**And** Recommendation: Extend stability period until 30 consecutive days achieved
**And** Product Manager approves extension, second pilot expansion deferred

## Implementation Tasks Evaluation

**Purpose:** Determine if this backlog story should be decomposed into separate Implementation Tasks (TASK-XXX artifacts) per SDLC Guideline v1.3 Section 11.

**Decision:** No Tasks Needed

**Rationale:**
- **Story Points:** 5 SP (CONSIDER per decision matrix - moderate complexity but straightforward execution)
- **Developer Count:** Single developer (framework maintainer or tech lead)
- **Domain Span:** Single domain (operational monitoring only - no code changes)
- **Complexity:** Low - daily monitoring checklist, log review, feedback collection
- **Uncertainty:** Low - clear monitoring procedures, well-defined success criteria
- **Override Factors:** None - no cross-domain changes, no unfamiliar activities

**Justification for No Tasks:** While 5 SP suggests "CONSIDER" decomposition, the straightforward nature (operational monitoring routine), single person execution, and lack of technical complexity make task decomposition unnecessary overhead. This is an operational story (daily checklist) rather than development work requiring technical tasks.

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**Question 1:** Should low-severity issues block second pilot expansion if count exceeds threshold (e.g., >20 low-severity bugs)?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Low-severity bugs don't block work but high volume may indicate framework immaturity
- **Recommendation:** No threshold for low-severity bugs during pilot; track for post-pilot prioritization; focus on zero high-severity bugs

**Question 2:** If high-severity bug discovered on Day 29, does clock reset to Day 0 or just extend by 1 day?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Full reset provides fresh validation period; 1-day extension more pragmatic but risky
- **Recommendation:** Full reset to Day 0 (conservative approach); ensures 30 consecutive bug-free days after fix validated

**Question 3:** Should stability period include automated chaos testing (deliberate infrastructure failures) or just normal operation monitoring?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Chaos testing validates resilience but may introduce artificial high-severity bugs; normal operation more realistic
- **Recommendation:** Defer chaos testing to future story (post-pilot production hardening); stability period monitors normal operation only

No open implementation questions requiring spikes or ADRs. All operational procedures clear from HLS-011 and PRD-006.
