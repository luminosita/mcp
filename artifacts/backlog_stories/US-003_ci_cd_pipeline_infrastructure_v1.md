## User Story
As a software engineer contributing code to the AI Agent MCP Server project, I want a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that automatically triggers on every feature branch commit, so that I receive build validation results within 5 minutes without manual intervention.

## Description
This story establishes the foundational CI/CD pipeline infrastructure for the project using GitHub Actions. The pipeline will automatically trigger on all commits to feature branches and execute a comprehensive validation suite including code quality checks, type safety validation, and automated testing. The infrastructure must be configured for fast feedback (<5 minutes), clear result reporting visible on PR pages, and main branch protection requiring passing builds before merge.

This is the foundational story for HLS-002 and must be completed before other validation stories (US-004, US-005, US-006) can implement their specific check stages.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§2.2: FastAPI Framework Architecture:** CI/CD pipeline will validate FastAPI application structure and async patterns
  - Pipeline stages mirror production runtime requirements
- **§2.1: Python 3.11+ Type Safety:** Pipeline enforces type checking with mypy to catch errors at build time
  - Async/await patterns require proper type annotations for validation
- **§2.8: Development Tooling (UV package manager):** Pipeline uses UV for fast, reproducible dependency installation
  - UV reduces CI build times by 10-50x compared to pip[^18]

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **§6.1: Slow Feedback Loops:** Pipeline optimized for <5 minute target through parallel job execution and caching
- **§6.3: Flaky Tests:** Pipeline design includes deterministic test execution and explicit failure categorization

**Performance Considerations:**
- **§2.8: Build Performance:** Dependency caching and UV package manager reduce build time from minutes to seconds
  - Target: <5 minutes total pipeline execution (per PRD-000 Goal 6)

## Functional Requirements
- GitHub Actions workflow triggers automatically on all commits to feature branches (not manual trigger)
- Pipeline executes comprehensive validation suite: linting, type checking, testing, coverage reporting
- Build status visible on GitHub PR page with clear pass/fail indicators
- Detailed failure logs accessible through GitHub Actions interface
- Main branch protected requiring passing builds before merge
- Pipeline handles concurrent commits from multiple developers without queue delays
- Build results returned within 5 minutes of commit push (95th percentile)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Pipeline execution completes within 5 minutes (p95 target per PRD-000 Goal 6)
- **Reliability:** >95% pipeline success rate on clean branches (no false failures from flaky tests or infrastructure issues)
- **Scalability:** Pipeline handles at least 10 concurrent builds without delays or resource contention
- **Maintainability:** Workflow configuration uses reusable actions and clear job structure for easy modification
- **Observability:** Pipeline logs provide actionable error messages with line numbers and suggested fixes
- **Security:** Pipeline uses GitHub-hosted runners with no access to production secrets (development environment only)

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** This story establishes CI/CD infrastructure. Technical Notes reference specialized CLAUDE-*.md standards that will be enforced by subsequent validation stories.

### Implementation Guidance

**GitHub Actions Workflow Structure:**
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Trigger: Push to feature branches (pattern: `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `chore/*`) and pull requests to `main`
- Exclude: Direct pushes to `main` branch (protected)
- Concurrency: Allow parallel builds per branch, cancel in-progress builds on new push to same branch

**Job Architecture (Parallel Execution):**
1. **Setup Job** (runs first, ~30 seconds):
   - Checkout code
   - Set up Python 3.11+
   - Cache UV dependencies
   - Install dependencies with UV
   - Cache artifacts for downstream jobs

2. **Validation Jobs** (run in parallel after setup, ~2-3 minutes total):
   - `lint-and-format` job: Ruff linting and formatting checks (US-004)
   - `type-check` job: Mypy type safety validation (US-005)
   - `test-and-coverage` job: Pytest execution with coverage reporting (US-006)

3. **Report Job** (runs after validation jobs, ~30 seconds):
   - Aggregate results from all validation jobs
   - Post build status comment to PR (success summary or failure details)
   - Upload coverage reports as artifacts

**Caching Strategy:**
- UV cache: `~/.cache/uv` (dependencies cached by lock file hash)
- Pytest cache: `.pytest_cache` (test results cached for faster re-runs)
- MyPy cache: `.mypy_cache` (type checking cache for incremental validation)
- Cache invalidation: Automatic on `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` changes

**Branch Protection Rules:**
- Main branch requires:
  - All validation jobs passing (required status checks)
  - At least 1 approving review
  - Branch up to date with base branch
  - No direct pushes (all changes via PR)

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- CLAUDE-tooling.md: Pipeline will invoke Taskfile commands (`task test`, `task lint`, `task type-check`)
  - Unified CLI interface ensures consistency between local and CI execution
- CLAUDE-testing.md: Pipeline enforces 80% coverage minimum (configured in subsequent US-006)
- CLAUDE-typing.md: Pipeline enforces strict mypy mode (configured in subsequent US-005)

**Note:** This story focuses on pipeline INFRASTRUCTURE. Specific validation configurations (Ruff rules, MyPy settings, pytest coverage thresholds) are implemented in subsequent stories US-004, US-005, US-006.

### Technical Tasks
- Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow configuration file
- Configure workflow triggers (feature branch pushes, PR events)
- Implement setup job with dependency caching strategy
- Define job dependencies and parallel execution strategy
- Configure branch protection rules on main branch via GitHub repository settings
- Add build status badge to README.md for visibility
- Test workflow with sample commit to feature branch
- Validate concurrent build handling with multiple test commits
- Verify cache effectiveness (second build should be significantly faster)
- Document workflow architecture and job purpose in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Acceptance Criteria

**Format: Gherkin (Given-When-Then)**

### Scenario 1: Automatic Pipeline Trigger on Feature Branch Commit
**Given** I am a developer who has committed code to feature branch `feature/test-pipeline`
**When** I push the commit to the remote repository
**Then** the CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers within 1 minute
**And** the build status is visible on the GitHub PR page
**And** the workflow runs the setup job followed by validation jobs in parallel

### Scenario 2: Pipeline Execution Completes Within Performance Target
**Given** the CI/CD pipeline has triggered for a commit on a feature branch
**When** the pipeline executes all jobs (setup, validation, report)
**Then** the total execution time is less than 5 minutes (p95 target)
**And** validation jobs run in parallel (not sequentially)
**And** dependency caching is utilized (cached build significantly faster than first run)

### Scenario 3: Build Status Visibility on PR Page
**Given** the CI/CD pipeline has completed execution
**When** I view the pull request page on GitHub
**Then** I see clear build status indicators (green checkmark for pass, red X for fail)
**And** I can click through to detailed logs for each job
**And** build status comment is posted to PR with results summary

### Scenario 4: Main Branch Protection Enforcement
**Given** I attempt to push directly to the main branch
**When** the push is executed
**Then** GitHub rejects the push with error message requiring PR workflow
**And** I am redirected to create a feature branch and pull request

**Given** I have a PR with failing CI/CD validation jobs
**When** I attempt to merge the PR to main
**Then** GitHub blocks the merge with status check requirement
**And** UI clearly indicates which validation jobs are failing

### Scenario 5: Concurrent Build Handling
**Given** 3 developers simultaneously push commits to different feature branches
**When** all 3 pipelines trigger concurrently
**Then** all pipelines execute without delays or resource contention
**And** each developer receives results for their specific commit within 5 minutes

### Scenario 6: Pipeline Failure Provides Actionable Feedback
**Given** a validation job fails (simulated failure for testing)
**When** I view the failed job logs
**Then** the error message includes specific failure reason and affected files
**And** logs are formatted for readability (not raw stack traces only)
**And** I can identify what needs to be fixed without expert CI/CD knowledge

### Scenario 7: Dependency Caching Effectiveness
**Given** I have pushed a commit to feature branch `feature/test-cache` (first run)
**When** the pipeline completes successfully
**Then** dependencies are cached for subsequent runs

**Given** I push a second commit to the same branch with no dependency changes
**When** the pipeline executes the setup job
**Then** cached dependencies are restored (not re-downloaded)
**And** setup job completes in <30 seconds (vs. 2-3 minutes without cache)
