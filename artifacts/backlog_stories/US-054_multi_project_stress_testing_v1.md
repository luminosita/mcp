- **HLS Section:** §Decomposition into Backlog Stories - Story 7: Multi-Project Stress Testing

## User Story
As a QA engineer, I want stress tests that validate multi-project isolation and concurrent request handling, so that I can verify zero ID collisions, zero cross-project data leakage, and performance targets (100 RPS, 50 concurrent ID reservations) before production deployment.

## Description
The Task Tracking microservice must handle concurrent requests from multiple projects without ID collisions, data leakage, or performance degradation. This story implements automated stress tests that simulate 5 concurrent projects sending simultaneous requests for task tracking and ID management. Tests validate:

1. **ID Uniqueness:** 50 concurrent `reserve_id_range` requests produce non-overlapping ID ranges (zero collisions)
2. **Task Isolation:** Project-alpha queries return only project-alpha tasks (no cross-project leakage)
3. **Performance:** 100 RPS sustained load with p99 latency <200ms for task tracking API
4. **Scalability:** 5 concurrent projects operate independently without resource conflicts or performance degradation >10%

Tests use load testing tools (e.g., Locust, k6, or custom Go test harness) and validate against production-ready scenarios (not just happy path).

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **Load Testing:** Simulate concurrent requests to validate performance under stress
  - **Tool Options:** Locust (Python), k6 (JavaScript), custom Go test harness, Apache JMeter
  - **Metrics:** Request rate (RPS), latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99), error rate
- **Concurrency Testing:** Spawn multiple goroutines/threads to simulate concurrent clients
  - **Go Example:** `go test` with parallel subtests (`t.Parallel()`)
  - **Validation:** Collect all returned IDs, assert uniqueness (no duplicates)
- **Database Validation:** Query database directly to verify isolation (project-specific data filtering)

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **Avoid Testing Only Happy Path:** Include edge cases (database slow response, connection pool exhaustion, serialization conflicts)
- **Avoid Single-Project Testing:** Must test with ≥5 concurrent projects to validate isolation
- **Avoid Ignoring Latency Percentiles:** p99 matters more than average latency for production validation

**Performance Considerations:**
- **Test Environment:** Use test database with realistic data volume (1,000 tasks, 100 ID registry rows)
- **Warmup Period:** Run warmup requests before measurement (populate connection pool, cache database plans)
- **Measurement Duration:** Run stress test for ≥60 seconds to stabilize metrics

## Functional Requirements
- Stress test: 50 concurrent `POST /ids/reserve` requests with zero ID collisions
- Stress test: 100 RPS sustained load on `GET /tasks/next` with p99 latency <200ms
- Isolation test: 5 concurrent projects querying tasks, validate zero cross-project data leakage
- Isolation test: 5 concurrent projects allocating IDs, validate independent sequences (project-alpha US-001 != project-beta US-001)
- Performance degradation test: Compare 1 project vs. 5 concurrent projects, validate <10% latency degradation
- Database validation: Query tasks and id_registry tables directly to confirm project_id isolation
- Test reporting: Generate report with metrics (RPS, p50/p95/p99 latency, error rate, ID collision count)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Reliability:** Stress tests must be deterministic (pass/fail consistent across runs)
- **Automation:** Tests run via `task stress-test` command (Taskfile integration)
- **Observability:** Test report includes latency histogram, error breakdown, database query plans (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
- **Maintainability:** Tests written in Go (integration with existing Go test suite) or Python (integration with existing Python test suite)

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** This story implements stress tests. Reference Go or Python implementation standards (CLAUDE-testing.md) for test harness patterns and performance measurement.

### Implementation Guidance

**Stress Test Implementation (Go Example):**

```go
package integration_test

import (
    "testing"
    "sync"
    "net/http"
    "encoding/json"
    "time"
)

// Test: 50 concurrent ID reservations produce non-overlapping ranges
func TestConcurrentIDReservationNoCollisions(t *testing.T) {
    const concurrency = 50
    const reservationCount = 6

    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    results := make(chan ReservationResponse, concurrency)

    // Spawn 50 concurrent requests
    for i := 0; i < concurrency; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()

            resp, err := http.Post(
                "http://localhost:8080/ids/reserve",
                "application/json",
                strings.NewReader(`{"type": "US", "count": 6, "project_id": "stress-test"}`),
            )
            if err != nil {
                t.Errorf("Request failed: %v", err)
                return
            }
            defer resp.Body.Close()

            var result ReservationResponse
            json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&result)
            results <- result
        }()
    }

    wg.Wait()
    close(results)

    // Collect all reserved IDs
    allIDs := make(map[string]bool)
    for result := range results {
        for _, id := range result.ReservedIDs {
            if allIDs[id] {
                t.Errorf("ID collision detected: %s", id)
            }
            allIDs[id] = true
        }
    }

    // Validate total unique IDs
    expectedTotal := concurrency * reservationCount
    if len(allIDs) != expectedTotal {
        t.Errorf("Expected %d unique IDs, got %d", expectedTotal, len(allIDs))
    }
}

// Test: 100 RPS sustained load with p99 latency <200ms
func TestTaskTrackingPerformance(t *testing.T) {
    const targetRPS = 100
    const duration = 60 * time.Second

    ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Second / targetRPS)
    defer ticker.Stop()

    latencies := make([]time.Duration, 0, targetRPS*60)
    errors := 0

    timeout := time.After(duration)
    for {
        select {
        case <-timeout:
            goto analysis
        case <-ticker.C:
            start := time.Now()
            resp, err := http.Get("http://localhost:8080/tasks/next?project=stress-test&status=pending")
            latency := time.Since(start)

            if err != nil || resp.StatusCode != 200 {
                errors++
            } else {
                latencies = append(latencies, latency)
            }
            resp.Body.Close()
        }
    }

analysis:
    // Calculate p99 latency
    sort.Slice(latencies, func(i, j int) bool { return latencies[i] < latencies[j] })
    p99Index := int(float64(len(latencies)) * 0.99)
    p99Latency := latencies[p99Index]

    t.Logf("RPS: %d, p99 latency: %v, errors: %d", targetRPS, p99Latency, errors)

    if p99Latency > 200*time.Millisecond {
        t.Errorf("p99 latency %v exceeds 200ms target", p99Latency)
    }
}

// Test: Multi-project isolation (no cross-project data leakage)
func TestMultiProjectIsolation(t *testing.T) {
    projects := []string{"project-alpha", "project-beta", "project-gamma", "project-delta", "project-epsilon"}

    // Create tasks for each project
    for i, project := range projects {
        taskID := fmt.Sprintf("TASK-%03d", i+1)
        createTask(t, taskID, project, "Test task")
    }

    // Query each project's tasks
    for _, project := range projects {
        tasks := getTasks(t, project)

        // Validate all tasks belong to queried project
        for _, task := range tasks {
            if task.ProjectID != project {
                t.Errorf("Cross-project data leakage: %s task returned in %s query", task.ProjectID, project)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Load Testing with Locust (Python Alternative):**

```python
from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class TaskTrackingUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(0.01, 0.1)  # 10-100ms between requests
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer test-key-12345"}

    @task(3)
    def get_next_task(self):
        self.client.get(
            "/tasks/next?project=locust-test&status=pending",
            headers=self.headers
        )

    @task(1)
    def reserve_id_range(self):
        self.client.post(
            "/ids/reserve",
            json={"type": "US", "count": 6, "project_id": "locust-test"},
            headers=self.headers
        )

# Run: locust -f stress_test.py --host=http://localhost:8080 --users=100 --spawn-rate=10
```

**Database Validation (SQL Queries):**

```sql
-- Validate project isolation in tasks table
SELECT project_id, COUNT(*) FROM tasks GROUP BY project_id;

-- Validate no tasks with mismatched project_id returned by API
SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE project_id = 'project-alpha' AND task_id IN (
    -- List of task IDs returned by GET /tasks?project=project-beta
);

-- Validate ID registry independence
SELECT artifact_type, project_id, last_assigned_id FROM id_registry ORDER BY artifact_type, project_id;
```

- Implement task tracking performance test (100 RPS, 60 seconds, measure p99 latency)
- Implement multi-project isolation test (5 projects, validate zero data leakage)
- Implement performance degradation test (1 vs. 5 projects, measure latency difference)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Zero ID collisions with 50 concurrent reservations
**Given** Task Tracking microservice running with empty id_registry for artifact_type=US
**When** stress test sends 50 concurrent POST /ids/reserve requests (count=6 each)
**Then** all 50 requests succeed (200 OK)
**And** 300 unique IDs allocated (50 * 6 = 300)
**And** zero ID collisions (all IDs distinct)
**And** id_registry final state: last_assigned_id = 300

### Scenario 2: Task tracking API handles 100 RPS with p99 <200ms
**Given** Task Tracking microservice running with 100 tasks in database
**When** stress test sends 100 RPS sustained load for 60 seconds (6000 total requests)
**Then** ≥99% of requests succeed (error rate <1%)
**And** p99 latency <200ms
**And** no connection pool exhaustion errors

### Scenario 3: Multi-project task isolation (zero data leakage)
**Given** tasks table contains 10 tasks for project-alpha and 10 tasks for project-beta
**When** stress test queries GET /tasks?project=project-alpha
**Then** response contains only project-alpha tasks (10 tasks)
**And** zero project-beta tasks in response
**And** database validation confirms zero cross-project leakage

### Scenario 4: Multi-project ID registry independence
**Given** id_registry contains rows for project-alpha (US last_assigned_id=10) and project-beta (US last_assigned_id=20)
**When** stress test sends concurrent GET /ids/next?type=US&project=project-alpha and GET /ids/next?type=US&project=project-beta
**Then** project-alpha receives US-011
**And** project-beta receives US-021
**And** project sequences remain independent (no interference)

### Scenario 5: Performance degradation <10% with 5 concurrent projects
**Given** Task Tracking microservice running
**When** stress test measures p99 latency with 1 project (baseline)
**And** stress test measures p99 latency with 5 concurrent projects (stress)
**Then** latency degradation = (stress_p99 - baseline_p99) / baseline_p99 <10%

### Scenario 6: Database isolation validation via SQL queries
**Given** stress test populates tasks and id_registry for 5 projects
**When** QA engineer runs SQL validation queries
**Then** SQL query `SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE project_id = 'project-alpha'` returns only project-alpha tasks
**And** SQL query `SELECT * FROM id_registry WHERE project_id = 'project-alpha'` returns only project-alpha registries

### Scenario 7: Stress test report generation
**Given** all stress tests completed
**When** stress test harness generates report
**Then** report includes: total requests, success rate, p50/p95/p99 latency, ID collision count, cross-project leakage count, performance degradation percentage
**And** report shows pass/fail status for each test

## Implementation Tasks Evaluation

**Purpose:** Determine if this backlog story should be decomposed into separate Implementation Tasks (TASK-XXX artifacts) per SDLC Guideline v1.3 Section 11.

**Decision:** No Tasks Needed

**Rationale:**
- **Story Points:** 3 SP - SKIP threshold (below 3-5 SP CONSIDER range)
- **Developer Count:** Single QA engineer or backend developer
- **Domain Span:** Single domain (testing/QA only - no production code changes)
- **Complexity:** Low - test implementation follows standard patterns (concurrent requests, latency measurement, database validation)
- **Uncertainty:** Low - load testing patterns well-established (Go testing, Locust, k6)
- **Override Factors:** None apply (testing story, not production code)

**Conclusion:** Story is within single developer capacity. Test harness implementation straightforward (concurrent goroutines or Locust load test). Task decomposition overhead not justified for 3 SP testing story.
