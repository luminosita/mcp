## User Story
As a software engineer preparing for production deployment,
I want to validate the containerized application in a staging environment,
So that I can confirm production readiness and environment consistency before deploying to production.

## Description
Deploy the production container image (from US-020) to a staging environment that mirrors production configuration, and validate that the application functions correctly with identical behavior to local development. This end-to-end validation confirms that container configuration, environment variables, network configuration, and application code work together correctly in a production-like environment. Successful staging validation provides confidence for production deployment.

This is the final validation story for HLS-005, confirming that the complete containerized deployment workflow (build, configure, deploy, run) is production-ready.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **ยง2.1: Python 3.11+ Technology Stack:** Validate Python runtime behaves identically in staging container
- **ยง2.2: FastAPI Framework:** Validate FastAPI application serves requests correctly in staging deployment

**Performance Considerations:**
- **Deployment Validation:** Verify application startup time and response time meet PRD-000 NFR requirements in staging environment

## Functional Requirements
- Staging environment configured to mirror production (container runtime, networking, resource limits)
- Production container image deployed to staging environment
- Application accessible via staging URL (e.g., https://staging.example.com or http://staging-host:8000)
- Health check endpoint responds correctly in staging
- Application behavior verified identical to local development (no environment-specific bugs)
- Environment variables configured correctly in staging
- Container logs accessible for debugging
- Staging deployment process documented (deployment steps, rollback procedure)
- Deployment validation checklist created covering all acceptance criteria
- Team confirms staging validation successful before proceeding to production

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Reliability:**
  - Staging environment stable for validation period (no crashes or restarts)
  - Application behavior deterministic (repeated tests produce same results)
- **Performance:**
  - Application startup time in staging meets <10 second requirement (PRD-000 NFR)
  - Response times comparable to local development (no unexpected degradation)
- **Observability:**
  - Container logs accessible via standard tooling (kubectl logs, podman logs, or equivalent)
  - Application logs structured and readable
- **Environment Consistency:**
  - Staging environment accurately represents production constraints
  - No "works in dev, fails in staging" issues discovered

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** This story references established implementation standards from specialized CLAUDE.md files, supplementing with story-specific technical guidance.

### Implementation Guidance

Deploy and validate container in staging environment:

**Staging Environment Setup:**
- **Container Runtime:** Same as production (Podman or Kubernetes)
- **Network Configuration:** Application exposed on port 8000 or via ingress
- **Environment Variables:** Staging-specific configuration (DATABASE_URL, API keys, LOG_LEVEL=INFO)
- **Resource Limits:** Production-like CPU and memory limits

**Deployment Process:**
1. Build production container image: `task container:build TAG=staging-vX.Y.Z`
2. Push image to container registry (DockerHub or organizational registry)
3. Deploy to staging environment:
   - **If Podman:** `podman run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env.staging <image>`
   - **If Kubernetes (future):** `kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/` (deferred to EPIC-005)
4. Verify deployment: Check container status, logs, health endpoint

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Container starts successfully in staging
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Application serves requests correctly
- [ ] Environment variables loaded correctly (check logs or config endpoint)
- [ ] No errors in container logs
- [ ] Application behavior matches local development (functional testing)
- [ ] Performance acceptable (startup <10s, response times reasonable)
- [ ] Container restart works correctly (stop and restart container)
- [ ] Rollback process tested (deploy previous version if needed)

**Validation Tests:**
- **Smoke Tests:** Health check, basic API endpoints
- **Functional Tests:** Core features work correctly
- **Configuration Tests:** Environment variables applied correctly
- **Performance Tests:** Startup time, response time measured
- **Reliability Tests:** Container restart, log accessibility

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- **CLAUDE-tooling.md:** Use Taskfile commands (`task container:build`, `task container:run`) for local validation before staging
- **CLAUDE-architecture.md:** Validate application structure works in container environment

**Note:** Treat CLAUDE.md content as authoritative - staging validation supplements with deployment-specific verification.

### Technical Tasks
- Configure staging environment (container runtime, networking, resource limits)
- Build production container image with staging tag: `task container:build TAG=staging-v0.1.0`
- Push container image to registry (DockerHub or organizational)
- Deploy container to staging environment
- Configure staging-specific environment variables (.env.staging or Kubernetes ConfigMap)
- Verify health check endpoint responds correctly
- Execute functional smoke tests (basic API endpoints)
- Measure application startup time (<10 seconds)
- Verify container logs accessible and readable
- Test container restart process
- Document deployment process and validation checklist
- Conduct team review of staging deployment (Product Owner, Tech Lead, DevOps)
- Create rollback procedure documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Format:** Gherkin (Given-When-Then) for scenario-based validation

### Scenario 1: Container deploys successfully to staging
**Given** production container image has been built and pushed to registry
**When** developer deploys container to staging environment
**Then** container starts successfully
**And** application is accessible via staging URL
**And** no deployment errors occur

### Scenario 2: Health check endpoint responds in staging
**Given** container is running in staging
**When** developer accesses health check endpoint (e.g., GET /health)
**Then** endpoint returns 200 OK status
**And** response contains system health information
**And** response time is acceptable (<2 seconds)

### Scenario 3: Application behavior matches local development
**Given** container is running in staging
**When** developer executes smoke tests (basic functional tests)
**Then** all tests pass
**And** application behavior identical to local development
**And** no environment-specific bugs discovered

### Scenario 4: Environment variables configured correctly
**Given** staging environment has staging-specific configuration
**When** developer inspects application logs or configuration
**Then** environment variables loaded correctly from staging configuration
**And** DATABASE_URL points to staging database (if applicable)
**And** LOG_LEVEL and other settings match staging requirements

### Scenario 5: Container logs accessible
**Given** container is running in staging
**When** developer accesses container logs (e.g., podman logs, kubectl logs)
**Then** logs are accessible and readable
**And** logs show application startup and request handling
**And** no error messages in logs (or expected errors only)

### Scenario 6: Application startup time meets requirements
**Given** container has been stopped
**When** developer starts container in staging
**Then** application reaches ready state within 10 seconds (PRD-000 NFR)
**And** health check endpoint responds successfully within 10 seconds

### Scenario 7: Container restart works correctly
**Given** container is running in staging
**When** developer stops and restarts container
**Then** container restarts successfully
**And** application returns to healthy state
**And** no data loss or corruption (if stateless application)

### Scenario 8: Team confirms production readiness
**Given** all validation tests pass
**And** staging deployment documented
**When** team reviews staging validation results
**Then** Product Owner confirms behavior acceptable
**And** Tech Lead confirms technical implementation ready
**And** DevOps confirms deployment process sound
**And** Team agrees to proceed with production deployment

## Implementation Tasks Evaluation

**Purpose:** Determine if this backlog story should be decomposed into separate Implementation Tasks (TASK-XXX artifacts) per SDLC Guideline v1.3 Section 11.

**Decision:** No Tasks Needed

**Rationale:**
- **Story Points:** 2 SP - Low complexity, validation and testing focus
- **Developer Count:** Single developer with team review - Minimal coordination overhead
- **Domain Span:** Single domain (deployment validation) - No cross-domain complexity
- **Complexity:** Low - Execution of deployment steps and validation tests, no new implementation
- **Uncertainty:** Low - Validation process straightforward, following deployment checklist
- **Override Factors:** None applicable
  - Not cross-domain (deployment validation only)
  - Not high uncertainty (validation steps are clear)
  - Not unfamiliar technology (deployment to container runtime, standard validation)
  - Not security-critical at validation level (deployment uses existing container from US-020)
  - Not multi-system integration (single application deployment)

**Conclusion:** This is a straightforward 2 SP validation story executing deployment steps and running validation tests. Developer can complete in <1 day following deployment checklist. Team review is part of acceptance criteria, not requiring separate task decomposition. Creating separate TASK-XXX artifacts would add overhead without coordination benefit.

- **US-022, US-023, US-024** completed (recommended) - Full local development and database setup validated before staging

**Related PRD Section:**
- PRD-000 Section 5.1 Functional Requirements (FR-13: Containerized deployment configuration validation)
- PRD-000 Section 7 User Experience - User Flow 1 (Developer validates container behavior)
- PRD-000 Section 10 Timeline & Milestones - Phase 3 (Final Validation criteria)

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**No open implementation questions.** All technical approaches clear from PRD-000 and HLS-005.

Staging deployment follows standard container deployment patterns. Validation checklist is straightforward smoke testing and functional verification. Environment configuration uses standard container runtime features (environment variables, port mapping). Team review process is organizational standard.

Implementation can proceed directly following deployment checklist and validation steps without requiring spike investigation or tech lead consultation.
