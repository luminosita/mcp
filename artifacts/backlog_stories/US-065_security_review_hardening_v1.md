## User Story
As a **Framework Maintainer**, I want **comprehensive security validation and vulnerability remediation** so that **MCP framework meets enterprise security standards before production deployment**.

## Description

The MCP framework handles sensitive operations (database access, artifact storage, ID management) requiring security hardening before production use. This story delivers:

1. **Security Checklist Validation** - Verify all NFR-Security requirements implemented
2. **Penetration Testing** - Automated security scanning for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, command injection)
3. **Authentication Audit** - Validate Task Tracking API enforces authentication for all endpoints
4. **Input Validation Audit** - Confirm MCP tools reject malformed/malicious inputs
5. **Rate Limiting Verification** - Test ID reservation endpoint respects 10 requests/minute limit
6. **Secrets Management Audit** - Ensure database credentials, API tokens in environment variables (no hardcoded secrets)
7. **Vulnerability Remediation** - Fix any high/critical vulnerabilities discovered during testing
8. **Security Report** - Document findings, remediation actions, residual risks

**Security Standards:**
- Zero high/critical vulnerabilities (CVSS score ≥7.0)
- Authentication required for all sensitive endpoints
- Input validation rejects 100% of malicious payloads (SQL injection, path traversal, command injection)
- Rate limiting enforced with 429 status code responses
- No secrets in source code, container images, or logs

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§5.1: JWT Authentication with RBAC** - Validate JWT token verification, audience/issuer checks, permission-based access control
  - **Example Code:** §5.1 shows `jwt.decode()` with RS256 algorithm, audience validation
- **§5.2: Secrets Management** - Audit AWS Secrets Manager or environment variable usage for sensitive credentials
  - **Example Code:** §5.2 demonstrates boto3 Secrets Manager client for credential retrieval
- **§5.3: Input Validation and Command Injection Prevention** - Validate Pydantic schema validation, safe subprocess execution
  - **Anti-Pattern:** §5.3 shows dangerous `os.system(f"git clone {repo_url}")` vs. safe `subprocess.run(["git", "clone", repo_url])`

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **§5.3: Command Injection via os.system()** - Penetration test confirms no shell=True usage with user input
- **§8.1 Pitfall 2: Insufficient Tool Description** - Not security-critical but review tool descriptions for information disclosure

**Security Considerations:**
- **§2.3: Database Connection Strings** - Validate connection strings use environment variables, not hardcoded in source
- **§6.1: Structured Logging** - Audit logs for leaked secrets (passwords, API tokens logged in plaintext)

## Functional Requirements
- Security checklist validation covering all NFR-Security requirements (01-04)
- Automated penetration testing with security scanning tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Bandit, Safety)
- Authentication enforcement verification (Task Tracking API rejects unauthenticated requests)
- Input validation tests (malicious payloads rejected by Pydantic validation)
- Rate limiting tests (ID reservation endpoint returns 429 after threshold exceeded)
- Secrets audit (grep codebase for hardcoded credentials, API tokens)
- Vulnerability remediation for any high/critical findings
- Security report generation (findings, CVSS scores, remediation actions, residual risks)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** Zero high/critical vulnerabilities (CVSS ≥7.0) after remediation
- **Compliance:** Input validation rejects 100% of OWASP Top 10 attack payloads (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, command injection, XXE)
- **Authentication:** 100% of sensitive endpoints require valid JWT or API key (zero unauthenticated access)
- **Auditability:** All security findings documented with CVSS scores, exploitation proof-of-concept, remediation evidence

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** Reference patterns-security.md and patterns-validation.md for implementation standards.

### Implementation Guidance

**Security Scanning Tools:**
- **Bandit** - Python static analysis for security issues (hardcoded passwords, SQL injection patterns, shell injection)
- **Safety** - Python dependency vulnerability scanner (checks dependencies against CVE database)
- **OWASP ZAP** - Dynamic application security testing (DAST) for API penetration testing
- **Trivy** - Container image vulnerability scanner (checks base image, OS packages, Python packages)

**Penetration Testing Methodology:**
1. **SQL Injection Testing** - Inject `' OR '1'='1` in all tool input fields, verify Pydantic validation rejects
2. **Path Traversal Testing** - Inject `../../etc/passwd` in file path parameters, verify validation blocks
3. **Command Injection Testing** - Inject `; rm -rf /` in shell command parameters, verify safe subprocess.run() usage
4. **Authentication Bypass Testing** - Call Task Tracking API endpoints without Authorization header, verify 401 Unauthorized
5. **Rate Limiting Testing** - Send 15 ID reservation requests in 1 minute, verify 429 Too Many Requests after 10th request

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- **patterns-security.md:** Authentication patterns (JWT validation), authorization patterns (RBAC), secrets management (environment variables)
- **patterns-validation.md:** Pydantic model validation with Field constraints, custom validators for dangerous patterns (shell metacharacters, path traversal)
- **patterns-tooling.md:** Use Taskfile command (`task security-scan`) to execute automated security scans
- **patterns-testing.md:** Security testing fixtures (malicious payloads, invalid JWT tokens)

**Note:** Treat patterns-*.md content as authoritative - supplement with story-specific penetration testing procedures.

### Technical Tasks

**Security Audit Tasks:**
1. Execute Bandit static analysis on MCP Server codebase, review findings (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection patterns)
2. Execute Safety dependency scan, identify vulnerabilities in Python packages
3. Execute Trivy container image scan on MCP Server Docker image
4. Review source code for hardcoded credentials (grep for patterns like `password=`, `api_key=`, `secret=`)
5. Review logs for secret leakage (search log output for API tokens, connection strings)

**Penetration Testing Tasks:**
1. SQL injection testing (inject malicious payloads in all tool input fields)
2. Path traversal testing (inject `../` sequences in file path parameters)
3. Command injection testing (inject shell metacharacters in subprocess parameters)
4. Authentication bypass testing (call API endpoints without valid credentials)
5. Rate limiting testing (exceed threshold for ID reservation endpoint)
6. XSS testing (inject `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in text fields, verify sanitization)

**Remediation Tasks:**
1. Fix high/critical vulnerabilities identified in scans (upgrade dependencies, patch code)
2. Implement missing authentication checks (add JWT validation to unprotected endpoints)
3. Strengthen input validation (add custom validators for dangerous patterns)
4. Implement rate limiting (add middleware for ID reservation endpoint)
5. Remove hardcoded secrets (migrate to environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager)

**Documentation Tasks:**
1. Generate security report (findings, CVSS scores, remediation actions, residual risks)
2. Document security testing procedures for future regression testing
3. Create runbook for incident response (security vulnerability discovered in production)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Authentication Enforcement (NFR-Security-01)
**Given** Task Tracking API endpoints requiring authentication (`POST /tasks`, `PUT /tasks/{id}/status`, `GET /ids/next`)
**When** Penetration test calls endpoints without Authorization header
**Then** All requests return 401 Unauthorized status
**And** Response includes error message: "Authentication required"
**And** Zero requests succeed without valid JWT or API key

### Scenario 2: Input Validation - SQL Injection Prevention (NFR-Security-02)
**Given** MCP tool accepting project_id parameter (e.g., `get_next_task`)
**When** Penetration test injects SQL payload: `project_id="' OR '1'='1"`
**Then** Pydantic validation rejects input with 422 Unprocessable Entity
**And** Error message indicates validation failure (not database error)
**And** Database logs show zero SQL execution with injected payload

### Scenario 3: Input Validation - Path Traversal Prevention (NFR-Security-02)
**Given** MCP tool accepting file path parameter (e.g., `resolve_artifact_path`)
**When** Penetration test injects path traversal payload: `file_path="../../etc/passwd"`
**Then** Validation rejects input with error message: "Path traversal detected"
**And** No file system access outside allowed directories (e.g., `/artifacts/`)
**And** Security log records path traversal attempt for monitoring

### Scenario 4: Input Validation - Command Injection Prevention (NFR-Security-02)
**Given** Subprocess execution in tool implementation (e.g., git operations)
**When** Code review examines subprocess calls
**Then** All subprocess calls use argument list (not shell=True with string concatenation)
**And** Zero instances of `os.system()` or `subprocess.call(..., shell=True)` with user input
**And** Bandit static analysis shows zero B602/B603 warnings (shell injection)

### Scenario 5: Rate Limiting Enforcement (NFR-Security-03)
**Given** ID reservation endpoint configured with rate limit: 10 requests/minute per project
**When** Penetration test sends 15 requests from project "ai-agent" within 60 seconds
**Then** First 10 requests succeed with 200 OK status
**And** 11th through 15th requests return 429 Too Many Requests
**And** Response includes Retry-After header: "60" (seconds until rate limit resets)

### Scenario 6: Secrets Management - No Hardcoded Credentials (NFR-Security-04)
**Given** MCP Server codebase and configuration files
**When** Security audit runs grep for hardcoded secrets: `grep -rE "(password|secret|api_key|token)\s*=\s*['\"][^'\"]+['\"]" src/`
**Then** Zero matches found (all credentials use environment variables or Secrets Manager)
**And** Database connection strings use environment variable: `os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")`
**And** JIRA API tokens use environment variable: `os.getenv("JIRA_API_TOKEN")`

### Scenario 7: Container Image Security Scan (Trivy)
**Given** MCP Server Docker image built with production Dockerfile
**When** Trivy security scan executed: `trivy image mcp-server:latest`
**Then** Zero HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities in scan report
**And** All base image OS packages up-to-date with security patches
**And** All Python dependencies free of known CVEs

### Scenario 8: Dependency Vulnerability Scan (Safety)
**Given** MCP Server Python dependencies (requirements.txt or pyproject.toml)
**When** Safety scan executed: `safety check`
**Then** Zero vulnerabilities reported in dependencies
**And** All packages at latest stable versions with security fixes
**And** If vulnerabilities found, upgrade packages and retest until clean

### Scenario 9: Log Sanitization - No Secret Leakage
**Given** MCP Server structured logging configuration
**When** Security audit reviews log output for sensitive data
**Then** Zero database passwords, API tokens, or JWT secrets logged in plaintext
**And** Sensitive fields masked in logs (e.g., `{"password": "***"}`)
**And** structlog configuration includes sanitization processor for secret fields

## Implementation Tasks Evaluation

**Purpose:** Determine if this backlog story should be decomposed into separate Implementation Tasks (TASK-XXX artifacts) per SDLC Guideline v1.3 Section 11.

**Decision:** Tasks Needed

**Rationale:**
- **Story Points:** 8 SP (DON'T SKIP per decision matrix - complexity requires decomposition)
- **Developer Count:** Multiple developers (security engineer for penetration testing, backend engineer for remediation)
- **Domain Span:** Cross-domain (backend security + infrastructure hardening + secrets management)
- **Complexity:** High - comprehensive security review covers authentication, input validation, rate limiting, secrets management, container security
- **Uncertainty:** Medium - penetration testing may uncover unknown vulnerabilities requiring investigation
- **Override Factors:**
  - **Security-critical:** This story validates all security NFRs; vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access
  - **Multi-system integration:** MCP Server + Task Tracking microservice + PostgreSQL + Redis + container infrastructure

**Proposed Implementation Tasks:**
- **TASK-019:** Execute automated security scans (Bandit, Safety, Trivy) and document findings (4-6 hours)
  - Deliverables: Security scan reports, vulnerability list with CVSS scores
- **TASK-020:** Conduct penetration testing (SQL injection, path traversal, command injection, auth bypass) (6-8 hours)
  - Deliverables: Penetration test report, proof-of-concept exploits for confirmed vulnerabilities
- **TASK-021:** Audit secrets management and remove hardcoded credentials (4-6 hours)
  - Deliverables: Grep audit report, migrated credentials to environment variables
- **TASK-022:** Implement rate limiting for ID reservation endpoint (4-6 hours)
  - Deliverables: Rate limiting middleware, Redis-backed request counter, 429 response handling
- **TASK-023:** Remediate high/critical vulnerabilities from scans and penetration tests (8-12 hours)
  - Deliverables: Patched code, upgraded dependencies, re-scan verification (zero high/critical findings)
- **TASK-024:** Generate security report and incident response runbook (3-4 hours)
  - Deliverables: Security findings report, remediation evidence, residual risk documentation, incident response procedures

**Note:** TASK IDs (TASK-019 through TASK-024) follow sequential allocation after TASK-018 (from US-063).

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**Question 1:** Should penetration testing use automated tools only (OWASP ZAP) or include manual testing by security engineer?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Automated tools fast but miss complex vulnerabilities; manual testing expensive but more thorough
- **Recommendation:** Use OWASP ZAP for initial scan, manual testing for critical endpoints (authentication, ID management)

**Question 2:** What is acceptable residual risk for LOW/MEDIUM vulnerabilities (CVSS 4.0-6.9)?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Zero vulnerabilities ideal but may require disproportionate effort for low-risk findings; need pragmatic threshold
- **Recommendation:** Accept MEDIUM vulnerabilities with documented mitigations (e.g., "SQL injection prevented by Pydantic validation, ORM usage"); zero HIGH/CRITICAL required

**Question 3:** Should rate limiting use Redis (distributed counter) or in-memory counter (per-instance limit)?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES ADR]
- **Context:** Redis provides global rate limit across MCP Server replicas but adds dependency; in-memory simpler but limit per replica (3 replicas × 10 req/min = 30 req/min total)
- **Decision Criteria:** If MCP Server has multiple replicas (horizontal scaling), Redis required; if single instance, in-memory sufficient
- **Recommendation:** Implement Redis-backed rate limiting for consistency with multi-replica deployments

**Question 4:** How should security report handle false positives from automated scans?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Bandit/Safety may flag non-issues (e.g., assert statements in tests); need process for triaging false positives
- **Recommendation:** Document false positives with justification (e.g., "B101: Assert used in test code only, not production - accepted"); exclude from final vulnerability count

No open implementation questions requiring spikes. All technical approaches clear from Implementation Research and PRD.
