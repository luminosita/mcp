## User Story
As a software engineer making database schema changes,
I want automated migration management with version control,
So that I can apply schema changes safely and rollback if needed without manual SQL scripts.

## Description
Implement a database migration management framework (Alembic for SQLAlchemy) enabling automated, versioned schema change management. Integrate migration commands into the unified Taskfile interface (`task db:migrate`, `task db:migrate:create`, `task db:migrate:rollback`). Migrations provide a clear audit trail of schema changes, enable safe schema evolution across development/staging/production environments, and support rollback if issues are discovered.

This story completes the database foundation by providing systematic schema change management, reducing risk of manual SQL errors and enabling confident database evolution.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **ยง2.3: Database & Storage - PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector 0.5+:** Migration framework manages PostgreSQL schema including pgvector extension and vector embedding tables
  - **Implementation:** Alembic migrations create and modify tables, indexes, and extensions defined in Implementation Research schema examples

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **Manual SQL Scripts:** Automated migration framework replaces error-prone manual schema changes
- **Unversioned Schema Changes:** All changes tracked in version control via migration files

## Functional Requirements
- Install and configure Alembic migration framework for SQLAlchemy
- Initialize Alembic with default configuration (alembic.ini, migrations/ directory)
- Add `task db:migrate:create` command to Taskfile for creating new migrations
- Add `task db:migrate` command to Taskfile for applying pending migrations
- Add `task db:migrate:rollback` command to Taskfile for rolling back last migration
- Add `task db:migrate:status` command showing applied and pending migrations
- Migration files stored in `migrations/versions/` directory under version control
- Migrations support both upgrade (apply schema change) and downgrade (rollback change)
- Alembic configuration includes database URL from environment variable (DATABASE_URL)
- Initial migration creates base schema (pgvector extension, initial tables if needed)
- Documentation updated with migration workflow (creating, applying, rolling back)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Usability:**
  - Migration commands discoverable via `task --list`
  - Clear output showing which migrations are being applied
  - Error messages actionable if migration fails
- **Reliability:**
  - Migrations are transactional (rollback on failure)
  - Migration version tracking prevents applying same migration twice
  - Downgrade (rollback) migrations tested before production use
- **Maintainability:**
  - Migration files include descriptive names and timestamps
  - Migration code reviewed like application code
  - Migration history preserved in version control
- **Safety:**
  - Migrations run in transaction (atomic apply or rollback)
  - Destructive operations (DROP TABLE, DROP COLUMN) clearly marked in migration
  - Rollback capability for all migrations (downgrade implemented)

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** This story references established implementation standards from specialized CLAUDE.md files, supplementing with story-specific technical guidance.

### Implementation Guidance

Set up Alembic migration framework for SQLAlchemy-based schema management:

**Alembic Installation and Configuration:**
1. Install Alembic: Add `alembic >= 1.12.0` to `pyproject.toml` dependencies
2. Initialize Alembic: Run `alembic init migrations` to create structure
3. Configure `alembic.ini`:
   - Set `sqlalchemy.url` to read from environment variable: `${DATABASE_URL}`
4. Update `migrations/env.py`:
   - Import application Base model for autogenerate support
   - Configure async database connection if using asyncpg

**Initial Migration:**
Create first migration establishing base schema:
```bash
task db:migrate:create NAME=initial_schema
```

Migration should include:
- Enable pgvector extension: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;`
- Create initial tables (if any defined, or placeholder for future)
- Create indexes

**Taskfile Integration:**
Add migration tasks to Taskfile under `db:` namespace:

```yaml
db:migrate:create:
  desc: "Create new database migration"
  cmds:
    - alembic revision --autogenerate -m "{{.CLI_ARGS}}"

db:migrate:
  desc: "Apply pending database migrations"
  cmds:
    - alembic upgrade head

db:migrate:rollback:
  desc: "Rollback last database migration"
  cmds:
    - alembic downgrade -1

db:migrate:status:
  desc: "Show migration status (applied and pending)"
  cmds:
    - alembic current
    - alembic history
```

**Migration Workflow:**
1. Developer makes schema change to SQLAlchemy models
2. Run `task db:migrate:create NAME=add_documents_table`
3. Alembic autogenerates migration based on model changes
4. Developer reviews and edits migration if needed
5. Run `task db:migrate` to apply migration to local database
6. Commit migration file to version control
7. CI/CD applies migration to staging/production environments

**Safety Practices:**
- Always implement both `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions
- Test downgrade locally before merging
- Use `batch_alter_table` for SQLite compatibility (if needed)
- Mark destructive operations with comments

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- **CLAUDE-tooling.md:** Follow Taskfile patterns for migration tasks
- **CLAUDE-architecture.md:** Migrations stored in `migrations/` directory following project structure

**Note:** Treat CLAUDE.md content as authoritative - migration framework supplements with database-specific tooling.

### Technical Tasks
- Install Alembic package (add to pyproject.toml)
- Initialize Alembic with `alembic init migrations`
- Configure `alembic.ini` to read DATABASE_URL from environment
- Update `migrations/env.py` to import application models for autogenerate
- Create initial migration establishing base schema (pgvector extension)
- Add `task db:migrate:create`, `task db:migrate`, `task db:migrate:rollback`, `task db:migrate:status` to Taskfile
- Test migration workflow (create, apply, rollback) locally
- Test autogenerate capability with sample model change
- Verify migrations work with containerized database from US-023
- Document migration workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md or DATABASE.md
- Add `.gitignore` entry for `__pycache__` in migrations/

## Acceptance Criteria

**Format:** Gherkin (Given-When-Then) for scenario-based validation

### Scenario 1: Alembic initialized successfully
**Given** project has PostgreSQL database configuration
**When** developer initializes Alembic
**Then** `migrations/` directory is created
**And** `alembic.ini` configuration file is created
**And** `migrations/env.py` is configured to read DATABASE_URL from environment

### Scenario 2: Initial migration created and applied
**Given** Alembic is initialized
**When** developer executes `task db:migrate:create NAME=initial_schema`
**Then** new migration file is created in `migrations/versions/`
**And** migration file includes upgrade and downgrade functions
**When** developer executes `task db:migrate`
**Then** migration is applied to database
**And** pgvector extension is enabled
**And** alembic_version table tracks applied migration

### Scenario 3: Autogenerate detects model changes
**Given** developer adds new SQLAlchemy model (e.g., Document model)
**When** developer executes `task db:migrate:create NAME=add_documents_table`
**Then** Alembic autogenerates migration based on model changes
**And** migration includes CREATE TABLE statement for new model
**And** migration includes corresponding DROP TABLE in downgrade

### Scenario 4: Migration applied successfully
**Given** pending migration exists
**When** developer executes `task db:migrate`
**Then** migration is applied to database in transaction
**And** console output shows migration being applied
**And** database schema updated with changes
**And** alembic_version table updated with new version

### Scenario 5: Migration rollback works correctly
**Given** migration has been applied
**When** developer executes `task db:migrate:rollback`
**Then** last migration is rolled back using downgrade function
**And** database schema reverts to previous state
**And** alembic_version table updated to previous version

### Scenario 6: Migration status command shows current state
**Given** some migrations have been applied
**When** developer executes `task db:migrate:status`
**Then** output shows current applied migration version
**And** output shows list of all migrations (applied and pending)

### Scenario 7: Migration failure rolls back transactionally
**Given** migration contains error (e.g., syntax error in SQL)
**When** developer executes `task db:migrate`
**Then** migration fails with error message
**And** database schema remains unchanged (transaction rolled back)
**And** alembic_version table not updated
**And** developer can fix migration and retry

## Implementation Tasks Evaluation

**Purpose:** Determine if this backlog story should be decomposed into separate Implementation Tasks (TASK-XXX artifacts) per SDLC Guideline v1.3 Section 11.

**Decision:** No Tasks Needed

**Rationale:**
- **Story Points:** 3 SP - Medium complexity, standard migration framework setup
- **Developer Count:** Single developer - No coordination overhead
- **Domain Span:** Single domain (database migration configuration) - No cross-domain complexity
- **Complexity:** Low-Medium - Alembic is standard migration tool for Python/SQLAlchemy with extensive documentation and established patterns
- **Uncertainty:** Low - Alembic setup is well-documented, migration workflow is standard practice
- **Override Factors:** None applicable
  - Not cross-domain (database migrations only)
  - Not high uncertainty (Alembic standard tool with clear docs)
  - Not unfamiliar technology (Alembic standard for SQLAlchemy projects)
  - Not security-critical at framework level (migration content reviewed separately)
  - Not multi-system integration (local database migration framework)

**Conclusion:** This is a straightforward 3 SP story setting up a standard migration framework with Taskfile integration. Developer can complete in 1 day following Alembic documentation and established patterns. Creating separate TASK-XXX artifacts would add overhead without coordination benefit.

## Additional Information
**Suggested Labels:** infrastructure, database, migrations, alembic, schema-management
**Estimated Story Points:** 3 (Fibonacci scale)
**Dependencies:**
- US-023 (Create Database Container Configuration) completed - Provides database to migrate
- Application has SQLAlchemy models defined (from HLS-003 or initial setup)

**Related PRD Section:**
- PRD-000 Section 5.1 Functional Requirements (FR-18: Automated database migration management)
- PRD-000 Section 8 Technical Considerations - Dependencies (PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector requires extension enablement in migrations)

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**No open implementation questions.** All technical approaches clear from Implementation Research and standard Alembic practices.

Alembic is the standard migration framework for SQLAlchemy-based Python projects with extensive documentation and community support. Migration workflow (create, apply, rollback) is well-established. Integration with PostgreSQL containers from US-023 is straightforward using DATABASE_URL environment variable. Taskfile integration follows patterns established in US-021 and US-023.

Implementation can proceed directly following Alembic documentation without requiring spike investigation or tech lead consultation.
