## User Story
As a developer, I want automated type checking with mypy in strict mode integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, so that type-related errors are caught before code review and the codebase maintains high type safety standards.

## Description
Configure mypy type checker with strict mode enforcement to validate type hints across the entire Python codebase. Type checking will execute as part of the CI/CD pipeline validation suite, providing immediate feedback on type safety violations. This prevents runtime type errors, improves code documentation, and enables better IDE support through comprehensive type annotations.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/ai_agent_mcp_server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§2.1: Python 3.11+ Type Safety:** Modern Python type hints with mypy strict mode provides static analysis to catch type errors at development time
  - **Benefit:** Catch errors before runtime, better IDE support, self-documenting code
- **§2.2: FastAPI + Pydantic Integration:** Pydantic v2 models provide runtime validation that complements mypy's static type checking
  - **Example Code:** Implementation Research §2.2 lines 78-94 (Pydantic BaseModel with Field validation)

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **§8.1 Pitfall 2: Insufficient Type Safety:** Manual JSON schema definition adds boilerplate and creates runtime errors; Pydantic validation prevents parameter mismatches
  - **Mitigation:** Leverage Pydantic's validation for ALL inputs with custom validators

**Performance Considerations:**
- **CI/CD Integration:** Type checking adds minimal overhead (<30 seconds for typical codebase) and catches errors that would be expensive to debug in production

## Functional Requirements
- Mypy type checker configured with strict mode in pyproject.toml
- Type checking executes on every CI/CD pipeline run
- Type errors fail the build with actionable error messages including file path, line number, and error description
- All Python source code in src/ directory must pass strict type checking
- Test code (tests/ directory) exempt from strict type checking to allow testing flexibility
- Clear documentation of type checking standards and common patterns
- Type stub installation automated for third-party libraries lacking type hints

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Type checking completes within 30 seconds for codebase <10,000 LOC
- **Security:** Type safety prevents entire classes of runtime errors (attribute errors, type mismatches)
- **Maintainability:** Type hints serve as inline documentation; strict mode enforces consistent standards
- **Reliability:** 100% of src/ code must pass type checking; zero tolerance for type errors in production code
- **Developer Experience:** Clear error messages with file locations; IDE integration for real-time feedback

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** References established implementation standards from specialized CLAUDE-*.md files with story-specific technical guidance.

### Implementation Guidance
Configure mypy with strict mode to enforce comprehensive type checking across the Python codebase. Strict mode enables all optional checks: disallow_untyped_defs, disallow_incomplete_defs, check_untyped_defs, disallow_untyped_decorators, no_implicit_optional, warn_redundant_casts, warn_unused_ignores, warn_no_return, warn_unreachable, and strict_equality.

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- **CLAUDE-tooling.md:** Use Taskfile command `task type-check` for local validation (lines 79-89)
  - Command runs: `mypy src/ --strict`
  - Generates HTML report: `task type-check:report`
  - Installs missing stubs: `task type-check:install`
- **CLAUDE-tooling.md:** MyPy configuration in pyproject.toml (lines 542-577)
  - Strict mode enabled with all checks
  - Python version: 3.11+
  - Test directory exempt: `disallow_untyped_defs = false` for `tests.*`
  - Third-party libraries: `ignore_missing_imports = true` for libraries without type stubs
- **CLAUDE-typing.md:** Type hints philosophy and patterns (entire document)
  - Always use type hints for function signatures (lines 14-18)
  - All public APIs must be fully typed
  - No `Any` type unless absolutely necessary
  - Use modern syntax: `list[str]` instead of `typing.List[str]` (Python 3.9+)
  - Use union types: `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]` (Python 3.10+)
- **Implementation Research §2.1:** Python 3.11+ type safety benefits (lines 68-95)
  - Type hints + mypy provides static analysis before runtime
  - Async/await support for type checking asynchronous code

**Story-Specific Technical Context:**
- Mypy integration into CI/CD pipeline must fail fast on type errors
- Type checking job runs in parallel with linting and formatting (US-004)
- Error output formatted for GitHub Actions annotations (file, line, column, message)
- Cache mypy cache directory (.mypy_cache) in CI/CD for faster subsequent runs

### Technical Tasks
- **Configuration:**
  - Update pyproject.toml with [tool.mypy] section (strict mode configuration)
  - Configure test directory exemption: [[tool.mypy.overrides]] for `tests.*`
  - Configure third-party library overrides for packages without type stubs
- **CI/CD Integration:**
  - Add `type-check` job to .github/workflows/ci.yml
  - Configure job to run in parallel with lint-and-format job
  - Add dependency on setup job for cache restoration
  - Configure mypy cache caching strategy (~/.mypy_cache)
- **Validation:**
  - Test type checking job with sample type errors (intentional violations)
  - Verify error messages are actionable (file path, line number, error description)
  - Validate cache effectiveness (second run should be faster)
  - Ensure test code remains exempt from strict checks

## Acceptance Criteria

**Format:** Gherkin (Given-When-Then) for scenario-based validation

### Scenario 1: Type checking executes on feature branch commit
**Given** I have committed code changes to a feature branch
**When** the CI/CD pipeline triggers
**Then** the type-check job executes mypy with strict mode
**And** the job runs in parallel with other validation jobs
**And** the job completes within 30 seconds (p95)

### Scenario 2: Type error fails the build with actionable feedback
**Given** I have introduced a type error in src/module.py (e.g., calling .upper() on int)
**When** the type-check job executes
**Then** the job fails with exit code 1
**And** the error message includes file path, line number, and description
**And** the error message is formatted as GitHub Actions annotation
**And** the build status on the PR shows type-check job failed

### Scenario 3: Valid type annotations pass type checking
**Given** all code in src/ has valid type annotations
**When** the type-check job executes
**Then** the job succeeds with exit code 0
**And** the build status on the PR shows type-check job passed
**And** no type errors are reported

### Scenario 4: Test code exempt from strict type checking
**Given** test code in tests/ has flexible type annotations (or missing annotations)
**When** the type-check job executes
**Then** the job does not fail due to test code type violations
**And** the job only validates src/ directory with strict mode

### Scenario 5: Third-party libraries without type stubs do not block build
**Given** the codebase imports third-party library without type stubs
**When** the type-check job executes
**Then** mypy ignores missing imports for configured third-party libraries
**And** the job does not fail due to missing type stubs
**And** a warning is logged indicating missing type stubs (optional)

### Scenario 6: Mypy cache improves subsequent run performance
**Given** the type-check job has executed once and cached .mypy_cache
**When** the type-check job executes again on a subsequent commit
**Then** mypy restores cache from previous run
**And** type checking completes faster than first run (cache hit < 15 seconds)

### Scenario 7: Local type checking matches CI/CD behavior
**Given** I run `task type-check` locally before committing
**When** the command executes
**Then** the same mypy configuration is used as CI/CD pipeline
**And** errors reported locally match CI/CD errors
**And** I can fix type errors before pushing code
