## User Story
As a software engineer developing the AI Agent MCP Server locally,
I want automatic code reloading when I save changes,
So that I can iterate rapidly without manually restarting the development server.

## Description
Configure the local development environment within Devbox to enable hot-reload capability, where code changes are automatically detected and applied without manual server restart. Integrate hot-reload into the unified Taskfile interface via `task dev` command. The development server should detect file changes within 1 second and reload the application within <2 seconds (PRD-000 NFR requirement), maintaining development velocity and reducing context-switching friction.

This story optimizes the local development experience by eliminating manual restart cycles, enabling developers to see code changes immediately after saving files.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **ยง2.2: FastAPI Framework:** Use Uvicorn's built-in `--reload` flag for hot-reload capability in development mode
  - **Implementation:** Configure uvicorn with `--reload` flag to watch Python files for changes

**Performance Considerations:**
- **Reload Speed:** Target <2 seconds from file save to application ready per PRD-000 NFR (line 222)
- **File Watch Performance:** Uvicorn's default file watcher (watchfiles) provides fast change detection (<1 second)

## Functional Requirements
- Configure development server with hot-reload enabled for local development
- Add `task dev` command to Taskfile starting development server with hot-reload
- Development server watches Python source files in `src/` directory for changes
- File changes detected within 1 second of save
- Application reloads automatically without manual restart
- Application ready to serve updated code within <2 seconds after file change (PRD-000 NFR)
- Hot-reload enabled only in development mode (not production)
- Developer receives clear indication when reload occurs (console output)
- Hot-reload works within Devbox isolated environment
- Hot-reload configuration documented in CONTRIBUTING.md or SETUP.md

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:**
  - File change detection: <1 second
  - Application reload time: <2 seconds (PRD-000 NFR requirement)
  - No significant CPU overhead from file watching
- **Usability:**
  - Hot-reload "just works" without manual configuration
  - Clear console output indicates reload occurred
  - Error messages displayed if reload fails
- **Reliability:**
  - Hot-reload reliably detects all file changes (no missed updates)
  - Application state resets cleanly on reload (no stale state)
  - Graceful handling of syntax errors during reload
- **Developer Experience:**
  - Zero-configuration setup (works immediately after environment setup)
  - Works seamlessly within Devbox environment
  - Compatible with various editors (VS Code, PyCharm, vim, etc.)

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** This story references established implementation standards from specialized CLAUDE.md files, supplementing with story-specific technical guidance.

### Implementation Guidance

Configure hot-reload in development server using Uvicorn's built-in capabilities:

**Uvicorn Hot-Reload Configuration:**
- Use `--reload` flag to enable automatic reloading
- Use `--reload-dir src/` to watch only source directory (avoids unnecessary reloads from other files)
- Use `--reload-delay 0.25` for fast reload cycle (250ms delay before reload)
- Default file watcher (watchfiles) provides cross-platform file change detection

**Taskfile Integration:**
Add `task dev` command to Taskfile:
```yaml
dev:
  desc: "Start development server with hot-reload in Devbox"
  cmds:
    - uvicorn src.main:app --reload --reload-dir src/ --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --log-level info
```

**Development vs Production Separation:**
- Development: Use `uvicorn --reload` (hot-reload enabled)
- Production: Use `uvicorn` without `--reload` (hot-reload disabled for performance)
- Environment variable `ENV=development` distinguishes modes if needed

**File Watching:**
- Uvicorn automatically watches `.py` files in specified directories
- Default watcher (watchfiles library) cross-platform compatible
- Watcher detects file changes via OS notifications (inotify on Linux, FSEvents on macOS, etc.)

**Error Handling:**
- Syntax errors in code displayed in console without crashing server
- Developer can fix errors and save again to trigger reload
- Server continues running even if reload fails

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- **CLAUDE-tooling.md:** Follow Taskfile patterns for `dev` task, integrate with existing task structure
- **CLAUDE-architecture.md:** Watch `src/` directory following project structure conventions

**Note:** Treat CLAUDE.md content as authoritative - hot-reload configuration supplements with development-specific settings.

### Technical Tasks
- Configure Uvicorn with `--reload` flag for hot-reload capability
- Add `--reload-dir src/` to watch only source directory
- Add `task dev` command to Taskfile starting development server with hot-reload
- Test file change detection speed (<1 second)
- Test application reload time (<2 seconds)
- Verify hot-reload works within Devbox environment
- Test hot-reload with syntax errors (graceful error handling)
- Test hot-reload across different file types (.py files in src/)
- Document hot-reload behavior in CONTRIBUTING.md or SETUP.md
- Verify hot-reload disabled in production configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

**Format:** Gherkin (Given-When-Then) for scenario-based validation

### Scenario 1: Development server starts with hot-reload enabled
**Given** developer is in Devbox environment
**When** developer executes `task dev`
**Then** development server starts with hot-reload enabled
**And** console output indicates hot-reload is active
**And** application is accessible on http://localhost:8000

### Scenario 2: Code change triggers automatic reload
**Given** development server is running with hot-reload
**When** developer modifies Python file in `src/` directory and saves
**Then** file change is detected within 1 second
**And** application reloads automatically without manual restart
**And** console output displays reload notification
**And** application is ready within <2 seconds after file change

### Scenario 3: Multiple file changes handled correctly
**Given** development server is running with hot-reload
**When** developer saves changes to multiple files in quick succession
**Then** hot-reload handles changes gracefully without multiple restarts
**And** application reflects all changes after reload completes

### Scenario 4: Syntax error handling
**Given** development server is running with hot-reload
**When** developer introduces syntax error in Python file and saves
**Then** server continues running without crashing
**And** error message displayed in console with file and line number
**And** developer can fix error and save again to trigger successful reload

### Scenario 5: Hot-reload works within Devbox environment
**Given** developer has entered Devbox shell with `devbox shell`
**When** developer executes `task dev`
**Then** hot-reload works correctly within Devbox isolated environment
**And** file changes detected from outside Devbox (editor running on host)

### Scenario 6: Hot-reload disabled in production mode
**Given** application is configured for production deployment
**When** application starts in production container
**Then** hot-reload is disabled (--reload flag not used)
**And** application runs with optimal performance (no file watching overhead)

### Scenario 7: Clear indication of reload events
**Given** development server is running with hot-reload
**When** file change triggers reload
**Then** console output clearly indicates reload occurred
**And** timestamp of reload displayed
**And** developer can verify changes were applied

## Implementation Tasks Evaluation

**Purpose:** Determine if this backlog story should be decomposed into separate Implementation Tasks (TASK-XXX artifacts) per SDLC Guideline v1.3 Section 11.

**Decision:** No Tasks Needed

**Rationale:**
- **Story Points:** 3 SP - Medium complexity, straightforward configuration
- **Developer Count:** Single developer - No coordination overhead
- **Domain Span:** Single domain (development environment configuration) - No cross-domain complexity
- **Complexity:** Low-Medium - Uvicorn provides built-in hot-reload, configuration is adding flags and Taskfile command
- **Uncertainty:** Low - Hot-reload is standard Uvicorn feature with well-documented usage
- **Override Factors:** None applicable
  - Not cross-domain (development configuration only)
  - Not high uncertainty (standard Uvicorn feature)
  - Not unfamiliar technology (Uvicorn hot-reload standard for FastAPI development)
  - Not security-critical (development-only feature)
  - Not multi-system integration (local development only)

**Conclusion:** This is a straightforward 3 SP story configuring a standard Uvicorn feature and adding a Taskfile command. Developer can complete in 1 day following established patterns. Creating separate TASK-XXX artifacts would add overhead without coordination benefit.
