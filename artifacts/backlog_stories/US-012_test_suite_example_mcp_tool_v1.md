## User Story
As a software engineer implementing new MCP tools, I want a comprehensive test suite demonstrating testing patterns for the example tool, so that I can write high-quality tests for my tool implementations following established patterns without researching testing approaches from scratch.

## Description

This story creates a comprehensive test suite for the example MCP tool that serves as living documentation for all testing patterns developers will use when implementing new tools. The test suite demonstrates unit testing, Pydantic validation testing, mocking patterns, error handling testing, and async testing approaches using pytest.

The test suite follows the testing pyramid principle (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E) and achieves >80% code coverage as required by project standards. Tests are organized clearly, use descriptive naming conventions, and include extensive comments explaining testing patterns for educational purposes.

This story is foundational for maintaining code quality across all future tool implementations, as developers will reference this test suite when writing tests for new tools.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§7.1: Unit Testing Patterns:** Demonstrates tool logic testing with mocked dependencies, Pydantic model validation testing
  - **Example Code:** Lines 952-988 - Tool logic testing with mocked JIRA client
- **§7.2: Integration Testing Patterns:** Demonstrates MCP protocol testing with client
  - **Example Code:** Lines 996-1024 - MCP tool discovery and invocation testing
- **§8.1: Error Handling Testing:** Demonstrates testing error classification and retry logic
  - **Example Code:** Lines 1152-1187 - Testing error types (authentication, rate limit, validation)

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **§8.2: Synchronous Blocking in Async Context:** All tests use async patterns with pytest-asyncio decorator
- **§8.1: Insufficient Error Handling:** Tests validate all error scenarios (validation, external failures, retryable vs. non-retryable)

**Performance Considerations:**
- **Fast Test Execution:** Mock external dependencies to keep tests under 1 second per test (CLAUDE-testing.md best practice)
- **Isolated Tests:** Use fixtures for setup/teardown ensuring test independence

## Functional Requirements
- Comprehensive test suite for example MCP tool covering all code paths
- Unit tests validating tool business logic in isolation
- Pydantic model validation tests ensuring type safety and input validation
- Mock patterns for external dependencies (no actual external calls in unit tests)
- Error handling tests for validation failures, external service errors, and edge cases
- Async test patterns using pytest-asyncio for all async functions
- Test fixtures demonstrating reusable test data patterns
- Test organization following project structure (tests/unit/, tests/integration/)
- Descriptive test names following convention: test_should_behavior_when_condition
- Inline comments explaining testing patterns for educational purposes

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Coverage:** Achieve >80% line and branch coverage for example tool implementation (meets project standard from CLAUDE-testing.md)
- **Performance:** All unit tests execute in <1 second, full suite completes in <30 seconds
- **Maintainability:** Tests organized clearly with fixtures in conftest.py, reusable test data patterns
- **Clarity:** Test names self-document expected behavior, inline comments explain patterns for learning
- **Reliability:** Tests are deterministic (no flaky tests from timing issues or external dependencies)
- **Isolation:** Tests run independently without shared state or ordering dependencies

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** Reference established implementation standards from specialized CLAUDE.md files. Supplement with story-specific technical guidance.

### Implementation Guidance

**Test Organization:**
- Follow directory structure from CLAUDE-testing.md: tests/unit/, tests/integration/, conftest.py
- Unit tests in tests/unit/test_example_tool.py covering tool business logic
- Integration tests in tests/integration/test_mcp_protocol.py validating MCP client interaction
- Shared fixtures in tests/conftest.py for reusable test data

**Pydantic Validation Testing:**
- Test valid inputs pass validation (happy path)
- Test invalid inputs raise ValidationError with appropriate messages
- Test edge cases (empty strings, boundary values, None values)
- Test custom validators if example tool uses them

**Mocking Patterns:**
- Mock external dependencies (no actual API calls, database access)
- Use unittest.mock.Mock for simple mocks
- Use pytest-mock (mocker fixture) for patching
- Demonstrate mock assertion patterns (assert_called_once_with, assert_called_with)
- Show side_effect patterns for testing error scenarios

**Async Testing:**
- Use @pytest.mark.asyncio decorator for all async test functions
- Demonstrate async fixtures if needed
- Test async context managers if example tool uses them
- Show proper await patterns in test code

**Error Handling Testing:**
- Test validation errors (invalid input types, missing required fields)
- Test external service errors (timeouts, connection failures, API errors)
- Test business logic errors (invalid state transitions, constraint violations)
- Verify error messages are actionable and include context

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- CLAUDE-testing.md: Follow testing patterns (AAA pattern, fixtures, markers, coverage requirements)
- CLAUDE-tooling.md: Use Taskfile commands (`task test`, `task test-cov`, `task test-watch`)
- CLAUDE-typing.md: Ensure test code uses type hints for clarity
- CLAUDE-architecture.md: Tests mirror src/ structure in tests/ directory

**Note:** Treat CLAUDE.md content as authoritative - supplement with story-specific context, don't duplicate.

### Technical Tasks
- Create tests/conftest.py with shared fixtures (sample tool inputs, mocked dependencies)
- Implement tests/unit/test_example_tool.py with unit tests:
  - Test tool business logic with mocked dependencies
  - Test Pydantic input validation (valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases)
  - Test error handling scenarios (validation errors, external failures)
  - Test async patterns with @pytest.mark.asyncio
- Implement tests/integration/test_mcp_protocol.py with integration tests:
  - Test MCP tool discovery (client can list tools)
  - Test MCP tool invocation (client can call tool with parameters)
  - Test MCP tool response validation (response matches expected schema)
- Configure coverage reporting in pyproject.toml (if not already configured)
- Add inline comments explaining testing patterns for educational purposes
- Verify >80% coverage with `task test-cov`

## Implementation Tasks Evaluation

**Purpose:** Determine if this backlog story should be decomposed into separate Implementation Tasks (TASK-XXX artifacts) per SDLC Guideline v1.3 Section 11.

**Decision:** No Tasks Needed

**Rationale:**
- **Story Points:** 3 SP (CONSIDER range per SDLC Section 11.6)
- **Developer Count:** Single developer (typical for test suite implementation)
- **Domain Span:** Single domain (testing only - no cross-domain changes)
- **Complexity:** Medium - Requires understanding testing patterns, async testing, mocking approaches, but straightforward implementation following established patterns from CLAUDE-testing.md
- **Uncertainty:** Low - Clear testing patterns documented in CLAUDE-testing.md and Implementation Research §7
- **Override Factors:** None apply (not cross-domain, not security-critical, not multi-system integration)

**Conclusion:** 3 SP story with single developer in familiar domain (testing following documented patterns) does not justify task decomposition overhead. Developer can implement entire test suite cohesively referencing CLAUDE-testing.md patterns without requiring separate task planning.

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**Backlog Story Open Questions capture IMPLEMENTATION uncertainties needing resolution during sprint.**

**Question Types:**
- [REQUIRES SPIKE] - Time-boxed investigation needed
- [REQUIRES ADR] - Significant technical decision (may need alternatives analysis)
- [REQUIRES TECH LEAD] - Senior technical input needed
- [BLOCKED BY] - External dependency

---

**Current Questions:**

1. **Test Data Management:** Should test fixtures use hardcoded data or factory patterns for generating varied test cases? [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
   - **Context:** Factory patterns enable testing multiple scenarios efficiently but add complexity. Hardcoded fixtures are simpler but may require many similar fixtures.
   - **Impact:** Affects test maintainability and readability
   - **Suggested Resolution:** Use hardcoded fixtures for common cases (happy path, basic validation), factory patterns only if testing many parameter variations

2. **Integration Test Scope:** Should integration tests include actual MCP client-server handshake, or mock the MCP client for faster execution? [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
   - **Context:** Real MCP handshake tests full protocol but slower. Mocked client tests tool logic integration but misses protocol errors.
   - **Impact:** Trade-off between test coverage and execution speed
   - **Suggested Resolution:** Include minimal integration test with real MCP client to validate protocol, use mocked client for remaining integration scenarios

---

**Note:** Questions marked [REQUIRES ADR] should trigger ADR creation before implementation begins.
