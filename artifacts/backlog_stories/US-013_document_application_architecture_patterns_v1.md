## User Story
As a software engineer (new team member or senior engineer implementing features), I want comprehensive architecture documentation explaining application structure, patterns, and extension points, so that I can understand the system design within 1 hour and implement new tools following established conventions without architectural trial-and-error.

## Description

The application skeleton (US-009 through US-012) has established FastAPI-based MCP server architecture with working example tool. This story creates documentation extracting architectural concepts from the implementation, explaining WHY patterns were chosen (not just WHAT they are), and guiding engineers to appropriate extension points.

**Context:** Per HLS-003 Decision D4, project follows "documentation-driven development" approach with hybrid strategy:
- **Inline documentation:** Docstrings and comments remain in code for implementation details (already present in US-009, US-010, US-011)
- **Architecture documentation:** Separate docs provide broader system context, visual diagrams, and design rationale (this story)

**Target Audience:**
1. **New team members** (2-4 years Python experience) - Need architecture overview within 1 hour to understand system design (HLS-003 NFR: Learnability)
2. **Senior engineers** (5-10 years experience) - Need design rationale to evaluate patterns and propose architectural improvements
3. **Feature implementers** - Need clear guidance on where/how to extend system for new MCP tools

**Value Delivered:** Documentation enables self-service architecture understanding, reducing senior engineer time spent explaining patterns and reducing architectural questions during code reviews.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§2.2 - FastAPI Framework:** Architecture documentation explains FastAPI selection rationale (async performance, Pydantic integration, auto-generated API docs)
- **§2.4 - MCP SDK (FastMCP):** Documentation shows how FastMCP abstracts protocol complexity while maintaining control
- **§2.5 - Pydantic-First Architecture:** Explains type safety strategy spanning API boundaries to LLM tool calling
- **§4.1 - Application Structure Pattern:** Documents src/ layout with separation between core framework and tool implementations
- **§4.2 - Dependency Injection Pattern:** Explains DI motivation and extension process for new services

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- **§1.1 - Stateful Protocol Lifecycle Management:** Documentation explains MCP's stateful nature requiring session management (distinguishes from REST APIs)
- **§1.2 - Type Safety Across Agent-Tool Boundary:** Rationale for Pydantic validation at tool boundaries with examples

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-1:** Architecture overview document explaining application structure with visual diagram
  - Diagram shows: FastAPI application → FastMCP integration → MCP Protocol → Tool implementations
  - Explains separation between framework code (src/mcp_server/core/) and tool code (src/mcp_server/tools/)

- **FR-2:** Dependency injection pattern documentation with extension guide
  - Explains WHY dependency injection chosen (testability, flexibility, explicit dependencies per HLS-003 Decision D4)
  - Step-by-step guide: "How to Add New Dependency" with code examples
  - Dependency graph diagram showing current services (config, logging) and extension points

- **FR-3:** Request flow documentation with sequence diagram
  - Diagrams: MCP client → FastAPI → FastMCP → Tool handler → Response
  - Explains lifecycle: connection initialization → tool discovery → tool execution → response serialization
  - References example tool (US-011) as concrete demonstration of flow

- **FR-4:** Pattern rationale documentation explaining architectural decisions
  - Answers: WHY FastAPI (not Flask/Django)? WHY Pydantic validation everywhere? WHY async patterns?
  - Each decision references Implementation Research sections justifying choice
  - Links to HLS-003 Decisions (D1: no external service integration, D2: single example tool, D3: abstract business logic)

- **FR-5:** Extension points guide for common scenarios
  - Scenario 1: "How to Add New MCP Tool" (reference example tool structure)
  - Scenario 2: "How to Add Database Access" (placeholder pattern in DI config)
  - Scenario 3: "How to Add External Service Integration" (circuit breaker pattern reference)

- **FR-6:** References to specialized CLAUDE.md standards
  - Maps architecture documentation to detailed implementation guides (CLAUDE-architecture.md, CLAUDE-typing.md, etc.)
  - Clarifies: "Architecture docs = system context, CLAUDE.md = implementation standards"

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Documentation must be scannable - engineers can find specific information within 5 minutes using table of contents
- **Accessibility:**
  - Visual diagrams (architecture, dependency graph, request flow) MUST include detailed text descriptions as alt-text equivalents
  - Assumes mid-level Python knowledge (no async/await tutorials, but explains MCP-specific patterns)
- **Maintainability:**
  - Documentation stored in /docs directory with clear version tracking
  - Includes "Last Updated" date and changelog for architectural changes
  - Format: Markdown for easy updates and version control integration
- **Learnability:** HLS-003 NFR target - new team member understands architecture within 1 hour of reading documentation

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** Architecture documentation references (not duplicates) specialized CLAUDE-*.md implementation standards. Each architectural concept links to corresponding CLAUDE.md file for deep-dive implementation details.

### Implementation Guidance

**Documentation Structure:**

```markdown
/docs/architecture/
├── overview.md                    # FR-1: System architecture overview + diagram
├── dependency-injection.md         # FR-2: DI pattern + extension guide
├── request-flow.md                # FR-3: Request lifecycle + sequence diagram
├── design-decisions.md            # FR-4: Architectural decision rationale

    ├── architecture-overview.mmd
    ├── dependency-graph.mmd
    └── request-flow-sequence.mmd
```

**Diagram Requirements:**
- Use **Mermaid markdown** for diagrams (version-controllable, easily updatable, renders in GitHub/IDE)
- Include textual description before each diagram explaining components
- Diagrams must be simple enough to understand in <3 minutes (avoid excessive detail)

**Content Extraction Strategy:**
- Review inline documentation from US-009 (app structure), US-010 (DI), US-011 (example tool)
- Extract WHY rationale from code comments into architecture docs
- Reference code locations for implementation details (e.g., "See src/mcp_server/core/dependencies.py for DI configuration")
- Link Implementation Research sections explaining technology choices

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- **CLAUDE-architecture.md:** Project structure, modularity patterns, separation of concerns
- **CLAUDE-typing.md:** Type safety strategy, Pydantic validation approach
- **CLAUDE-validation.md:** Input validation patterns, security considerations
- **CLAUDE-testing.md:** Testing strategy for architecture validation
- **CLAUDE-tooling.md:** Development commands for running/testing application

**Documentation Style:**
- Explanatory (WHY patterns chosen) not just descriptive (WHAT code does)
- Code snippets show key concepts, link to full implementation
- Assume reader has Python knowledge, explain MCP-specific and project-specific patterns
- Friendly tone avoiding jargon where possible (or define terms when needed)

### Technical Tasks

- **Task 1:** Create /docs/architecture/ directory structure with placeholder files
- **Task 2:** Write overview.md with system architecture diagram (Mermaid) explaining FastAPI + FastMCP + Tools layer
- **Task 3:** Write dependency-injection.md extracting DI rationale from US-010, with step-by-step extension guide and dependency graph diagram
- **Task 4:** Write request-flow.md with Mermaid sequence diagram showing MCP request lifecycle from client to tool execution
- **Task 5:** Write design-decisions.md documenting technology choices (FastAPI, Pydantic, async patterns) with Implementation Research citations
- **Task 6:** Write extension-guides/ with three how-to documents (add tool, add database, add external service) referencing example tool and CLAUDE.md standards
- **Task 7:** Review documentation with new team member (if available) or senior engineer for clarity, completeness, and 1-hour understandability target

## Acceptance Criteria

**Format:** Gherkin format for scenario-based validation

### Scenario 1: New Team Member Onboarding

**And** documentation structure allows updating specific sections without full rewrite
**And** Mermaid diagrams can be updated by editing markdown (no binary image files)

## Implementation Tasks Evaluation

**Purpose:** Determine if this backlog story should be decomposed into separate Implementation Tasks (TASK-XXX artifacts) per SDLC Guideline v1.3 Section 11.

**Decision:** No Tasks Needed

**Rationale:**
- **Story Points:** 2 SP (SKIP range per SDLC Section 11.6 - overhead not justified for simple documentation)
- **Developer Count:** Single developer (documentation work typically individual contributor)
- **Domain Span:** Single domain (documentation only, no code changes across frontend/backend/database)
- **Complexity:** Low - straightforward documentation extraction from existing code with established structure
- **Uncertainty:** Low - clear documentation structure defined, content sources identified (US-009, US-010, US-011)
- **Override Factors:** None present
  - Not cross-domain (documentation only)
  - Not high uncertainty (documentation template and content sources clear)
  - Not unfamiliar technology (Markdown + Mermaid diagrams, standard tools)
  - Not security-critical (documentation has no security implications)
  - Not multi-system integration (no system integration, pure documentation)

**Implementation Approach:** Single developer implements documentation in one pass following defined structure (FR-1 through FR-6). Documentation tasks (Task 1-7 listed in Technical Tasks section) are sequential steps within same work session, not parallel work requiring coordination.

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 8-10 hours total:
- 1 hour: Directory setup + overview.md + architecture diagram
- 2 hours: dependency-injection.md + DI diagram
- 2 hours: request-flow.md + sequence diagram
- 1 hour: design-decisions.md
- 2-3 hours: Extension guides (3 documents)
- 1 hour: Review and refinement

## Additional Information

**Suggested Labels:** documentation, architecture, onboarding, foundation
**Estimated Story Points:** 2 (Fibonacci scale)
**Dependencies:**
- **Depends On:** US-009 (FastAPI Application Structure) - MUST be completed first, provides application structure to document
- **Depends On:** US-010 (Dependency Injection Foundation) - MUST be completed first, provides DI patterns to document
- **Depends On:** US-011 (Example MCP Tool Implementation) - MUST be completed first, provides example tool to reference
- **Depends On:** US-012 (Test Suite for Example Tool) - SHOULD be completed first, provides testing patterns to reference in extension guides
- **Recommended Sequence:** Implement last after US-009 through US-012 complete (per HLS-003 decomposition strategy - "Implement last after architecture proven through US-009 through US-012")

**Related PRD Section:** PRD-000 Section 5.1 (FR-09)

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**No open implementation questions.** All technical approaches clear from HLS-003 and Implementation Research.

**Rationale:**
- Documentation structure defined in FR-1 through FR-6
- Content sources identified (US-009, US-010, US-011 inline documentation)
- Diagram tooling specified (Mermaid markdown)
- Style guidance provided (explanatory WHY focus, reference code examples)
- Target audience and success criteria clear (1-hour understandability, HLS-003 NFR)

**Note:** If documentation review (Task 7) reveals clarity issues, developer iterates on specific sections until 1-hour understandability target met. This is normal documentation refinement, not architectural uncertainty requiring spike or ADR.
