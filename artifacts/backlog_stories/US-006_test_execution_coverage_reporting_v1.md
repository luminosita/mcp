## User Story
As a software engineer contributing code to the AI Agent MCP Server project, I want automated test execution with coverage reporting on every commit, so that I receive immediate feedback on test failures and can verify that new code includes adequate test coverage before code review.

## Description
This story implements automated test suite execution using pytest integrated into the CI/CD pipeline established by US-003. The system will automatically run all unit, integration, and end-to-end tests on every commit to feature branches, enforce the >80% coverage threshold, and provide detailed coverage reports showing which code paths are tested. This automation ensures consistent quality standards, catches regressions early, and prevents untested code from reaching the main branch.

This story builds on US-003 (CI/CD Pipeline Infrastructure) by adding the "test-and-coverage" validation job to the pipeline. It focuses solely on test execution and coverage validation; code quality checks (Ruff) and type safety validation (MyPy) are handled in US-004 and US-005 respectively.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§7.1: Unit Testing with pytest:** Test framework provides async support, fixtures, and parametrized tests for comprehensive test coverage
  - Async test support essential for FastAPI async endpoints and tool implementations
- **§2.2: FastAPI Framework Architecture:** Test suite validates FastAPI async patterns, dependency injection, and request/response handling
  - Integration tests verify end-to-end API flows including MCP protocol communication

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **§6.1: Flaky Tests (Reliability):** Deterministic test design prevents false failures that erode trust in automation
  - Proper test isolation, no randomness, explicit fixtures
- **§8.1 Pitfall 1: Synchronous Blocking Calls:** Async test support with pytest-asyncio validates async implementation patterns
  - Tests verify tools use async libraries (httpx) not blocking libraries (requests)

**Performance Considerations:**
- Test suite execution target: <2 minutes for full suite (unit + integration)
- Coverage report generation: <10 seconds additional overhead
- Parallel test execution to maximize CI/CD pipeline efficiency

## Functional Requirements
- Pytest test framework configured in pyproject.toml with async support
- Test suite execution runs all tests (unit, integration, e2e) in CI/CD pipeline
- Coverage threshold enforcement: Builds fail if coverage <80%
- Coverage reports generated in multiple formats (terminal summary, HTML report, XML for CI integration)
- Pytest cache configured for faster subsequent runs
- Test fixtures defined in conftest.py for common setup patterns
- Failed tests reported with clear error messages and stack traces
- Coverage reports show uncovered lines with file paths and line numbers

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Full test suite execution <2 minutes (including coverage calculation)
- **Reliability:** >99% test determinism (no flaky tests causing intermittent failures)
- **Scalability:** Test suite architecture supports growth to 1000+ tests without linear time increase
- **Maintainability:** Test fixtures reduce duplication, tests follow consistent patterns per CLAUDE-testing.md
- **Developer Experience:** Local test execution matches CI/CD behavior for debugging

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** References specialized CLAUDE-testing.md standards for testing patterns. Story supplements with US-006-specific configuration details.

### Implementation Guidance
Configure pytest in pyproject.toml with comprehensive test discovery, async support, and coverage integration. Add test-and-coverage job to CI/CD workflow (from US-003) that runs pytest with coverage threshold enforcement. Provide detailed coverage reports accessible through build output.

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- CLAUDE-testing.md: Testing strategy (80% coverage minimum, fixture patterns, async test support, test categories)
- CLAUDE-tooling.md: Use Taskfile commands (`task test`, `task test:coverage`, `task test:unit`, `task test:integration`)
- CLAUDE-architecture.md: Test directory structure (tests/unit/, tests/integration/, tests/e2e/, conftest.py fixtures)
- CLAUDE-typing.md: Type hints in test code (test parameters, fixture return types for IDE support)

**Note:** Treat CLAUDE.md content as authoritative - supplement with story-specific context, don't duplicate.

### Technical Tasks
1. Configure pytest in pyproject.toml with test discovery rules
   - Set testpaths = ["tests"]
   - Configure asyncio_mode = "auto" for pytest-asyncio
   - Add markers for test categories (unit, integration, e2e, slow)
   - Configure logging capture and output formatting
2. Update .github/workflows/ci.yml with test-and-coverage job
   - Run `pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-report=html --cov-fail-under=80`
   - Configure job to run in parallel with lint-and-format and type-check jobs
   - Add dependency on setup job for cache restoration
   - Upload coverage reports as build artifacts
3. Configure pytest cache caching strategy (.pytest_cache)
4. Create conftest.py with common fixtures
   - FastAPI test client fixture (TestClient for sync, AsyncClient for async endpoints)
   - Database session fixture (isolated test database, rollback after each test)
   - Mock external services fixtures (JIRA API, CI/CD systems)
5. Add local Taskfile commands: `task test`, `task test:coverage`, `task test:unit`, `task test:integration`, `task test:watch`
6. Write example unit tests demonstrating fixture usage and async patterns
7. Write example integration tests for FastAPI endpoints
8. Test with intentional test failure to verify error reporting
9. Verify coverage threshold enforcement (reduce coverage below 80%, confirm build fails)
10. Document testing strategy and fixture usage in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Acceptance Criteria

**Format Guidance:** Gherkin format (Given-When-Then) for scenario-based validation

### Scenario 1: Automatic test execution on feature branch commit
**Given** a developer has committed code with tests to feature branch
**When** the commit is pushed to the remote repository
**Then** the CI/CD pipeline test-and-coverage job triggers automatically within 1 minute
**And** pytest executes all discovered tests in tests/ directory
**And** test results are visible in the build output

### Scenario 2: Test failure blocks build
**Given** a developer commits code that causes test failures
**When** the CI/CD pipeline runs test-and-coverage job
**Then** the build fails with clear indication of which tests failed
**And** error messages include test name, assertion failure, and stack trace
**And** PR status check shows "Tests Failed" preventing merge

### Scenario 3: Coverage threshold enforcement
**Given** code committed has test coverage below 80%
**When** the CI/CD pipeline runs test-and-coverage job with --cov-fail-under=80 flag
**Then** the build fails with coverage report showing current percentage
**And** coverage report lists uncovered files and line numbers
**And** developer can identify which code needs additional tests

### Scenario 4: Coverage threshold met allows build to pass
**Given** code committed has test coverage ≥80%
**When** the CI/CD pipeline runs test-and-coverage job
**Then** all tests pass and coverage threshold is satisfied
**And** build status shows "Tests Passed" with coverage percentage
**And** coverage reports uploaded as build artifacts

### Scenario 5: Coverage reports accessible
**Given** the CI/CD pipeline has completed test-and-coverage job
**When** a developer views the build output
**Then** terminal coverage report is visible showing coverage percentage per file
**And** HTML coverage report is available as downloadable build artifact
**And** XML coverage report is generated for integration with coverage tracking tools
**And** reports highlight uncovered lines with line numbers

### Scenario 6: Pytest cache improves performance
**Given** test suite has run previously in CI/CD pipeline
**When** subsequent builds execute test-and-coverage job
**Then** pytest cache is restored from CI cache
**And** pytest uses cache to skip unnecessary setup
**And** test execution time is reduced compared to cold cache run

### Scenario 7: Local test execution matches CI/CD behavior
**Given** a developer runs tests locally using `task test`
**When** tests are executed in local environment
**Then** pytest configuration matches CI/CD configuration
**And** test discovery finds same tests as CI/CD
**And** coverage threshold enforcement behaves identically
**And** developer can debug test failures locally before pushing

### Scenario 8: Async test support validated
**Given** test suite includes async tests for FastAPI endpoints and async tools
**When** pytest-asyncio plugin runs async tests
**Then** async tests execute correctly with proper event loop handling
**And** async fixtures work for database sessions and HTTP clients
**And** no warnings about coroutines not being awaited

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**Note:** No open implementation questions at this time. Testing approach is clear from Implementation Research §7.1 and CLAUDE-testing.md standards. Pytest is well-established testing framework with comprehensive async support via pytest-asyncio. Coverage enforcement via pytest-cov with --cov-fail-under flag is standard pattern.

**Resolved during planning:**
- ~~"Should we use pytest or unittest?"~~ → pytest (standard for FastAPI, async support, better fixtures)
- ~~"What coverage threshold?"~~ → 80% minimum (per PRD-000 FR-06 and CLAUDE-testing.md)
- ~~"How to handle async tests?"~~ → pytest-asyncio plugin (Implementation Research §7.1)
- ~~"Where to store test fixtures?"~~ → conftest.py (pytest standard pattern, CLAUDE-architecture.md)
