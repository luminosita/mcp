## User Story
As a software engineer maintaining the AI Agent MCP Server project, I want automated dependency scanning and update pull requests, so that project dependencies remain current with security patches and new versions without requiring manual monitoring and update effort.

## Description
This story implements Renovate bot to automatically detect outdated dependencies and security vulnerabilities in project dependencies (Python packages in pyproject.toml). Renovate creates pull requests automatically with dependency updates, providing changelogs, release notes, and compatibility information. The automation reduces manual maintenance burden, improves security posture by applying security patches quickly, and keeps the project current with ecosystem improvements.

Renovate configuration prioritizes security updates (immediate PRs) over version updates (batched weekly) to balance responsiveness with PR noise. The bot respects project quality gates (CI/CD pipeline must pass) before suggesting merge, ensuring updates don't introduce regressions.

This is the final infrastructure story in HLS-002, enabling ongoing project maintenance after core CI/CD pipeline (US-003 through US-007) is operational.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§5.2: Secrets Management (AWS Secrets Manager):** Dependency updates may require updating secrets (API tokens with new scopes)
  - Renovate PRs include guidance on secret updates if dependencies change authentication requirements
- **§2.1: Python 3.11+ Technology Stack:** Renovate monitors pyproject.toml for Python package updates
  - Ensures compatibility with Python 3.11+ type hints and async features

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **Manual dependency monitoring:** Automated scanning eliminates need for developers to manually check for updates
  - Reduces toil and ensures consistent update cadence
- **Stale dependencies creating security vulnerabilities:** Timely automated updates reduce exposure window for known CVEs
  - Security patches applied within days not months

**Performance Considerations:**
- Renovate runs asynchronously (no impact on developer workflow or CI/CD pipeline performance)
- PR creation throttled to prevent overwhelming team with too many simultaneous update PRs
- Batching strategy reduces review overhead while maintaining security responsiveness

## Functional Requirements
- Renovate bot configured via renovate.json in repository root
- Automated scanning of pyproject.toml for outdated Python dependencies
- Security vulnerability detection using Python security databases
- Automated PR creation for dependency updates with changelogs and release notes
- Batching strategy: Security updates (immediate individual PRs), minor updates (weekly batch), major updates (individual PRs for review)
- PR includes compatibility information (breaking changes, deprecations)
- Renovate respects CI/CD pipeline (PRs must pass all checks before merge suggestion)
- Auto-merge disabled (team review required for all dependency updates)
- GitHub Actions integration for Renovate execution
- Dashboard showing dependency status and pending updates

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** Security vulnerability PRs created within 24 hours of CVE publication
- **Reliability:** Renovate bot runs daily to detect new updates
- **Maintainability:** Renovate configuration self-documenting with comments explaining batching strategy
- **Developer Experience:** PR descriptions include clear update rationale and compatibility notes
- **Operational Simplicity:** Renovate hosted by organization (no self-hosted runner required)

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** References specialized CLAUDE-tooling.md standards for dependency management. Story supplements with US-008-specific Renovate configuration.

### Implementation Guidance
Configure Renovate bot in renovate.json with custom rules for Python dependencies. Set up batching strategy to balance security responsiveness with PR volume management. Configure Renovate to respect CI/CD pipeline checks and require manual approval for merges.

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- CLAUDE-tooling.md: UV package manager (Renovate monitors pyproject.toml + uv.lock), dependency update workflow
- PRD-000: FR-16, FR-21 requirements for automated dependency management
- PRD-000 Decision D2: Organizational platform standards (Renovate hosted by organization)

**Note:** Treat CLAUDE.md content as authoritative - supplement with story-specific context, don't duplicate.

### Technical Tasks
1. Create renovate.json configuration file in repository root
   - Enable Renovate bot for Python dependencies (pyproject.toml + uv.lock)
   - Configure dependency dashboards for visibility
   - Set timezone and schedule (daily runs during off-peak hours)
2. Configure batching strategy
   - Security updates: Create individual PRs immediately (grouping disabled)
   - Minor updates: Batch weekly (combine multiple minor version bumps)
   - Major updates: Create individual PRs (require careful review)
3. Configure PR behavior
   - Auto-merge: disabled (team review required)
   - Commit message format: "chore(deps): update [package] to v[version]"
   - PR title format: "[Security] Update [package]" or "Update dependencies (weekly batch)"
   - Include changelogs and release notes in PR description
4. Configure compatibility checks
   - Respect CI/CD pipeline (PRs must pass all checks)
   - Enable Python version compatibility validation
   - Check for breaking changes in major version updates
5. Configure ignore patterns
   - Pin critical dependencies if needed (e.g., specific framework versions)
   - Ignore alpha/beta versions (only stable releases)
6. Enable Renovate GitHub App for repository
   - Grant Renovate read access to repository
   - Grant Renovate write access for PR creation
   - Configure Renovate authentication for private repositories (if needed)
7. Test Renovate configuration
   - Manually trigger Renovate run via GitHub Actions
   - Verify PR creation for known outdated dependency
   - Verify batching behavior (minor updates batched, security updates immediate)
   - Verify PR includes changelogs and compatibility information
8. Document Renovate workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Explain batching strategy and PR types
   - Document how to review and merge Renovate PRs
   - Provide troubleshooting guidance for Renovate issues

## Acceptance Criteria

**Format Guidance:** Gherkin format (Given-When-Then) for scenario-based validation

### Scenario 1: Renovate detects outdated dependencies
**Given** pyproject.toml contains dependencies with available updates
**When** Renovate bot runs daily scan
**Then** outdated dependencies are detected
**And** dependency dashboard is updated showing pending updates
**And** PRs are created according to batching strategy

### Scenario 2: Security vulnerability creates immediate PR
**Given** a security vulnerability is published (CVE) for project dependency
**When** Renovate scans dependencies within 24 hours
**Then** individual PR is created immediately (not batched)
**And** PR title includes "[Security]" indicator
**And** PR description includes CVE details and severity level
**And** PR description includes recommended action (update immediately)

### Scenario 3: Minor updates batched weekly
**Given** multiple minor version updates are available (e.g., 1.2.0 → 1.2.1, 2.3.4 → 2.3.5)
**When** weekly batch window arrives (Sunday midnight)
**Then** Renovate creates single PR combining all minor updates
**And** PR title indicates "Update dependencies (weekly batch)"
**And** PR description lists all updated packages with version changes
**And** PR includes combined changelog from all updates

### Scenario 4: Major updates create individual PRs
**Given** major version update is available (e.g., FastAPI 0.100.0 → 1.0.0)
**When** Renovate detects major version bump
**Then** individual PR is created (not batched)
**And** PR title indicates major version update
**And** PR description highlights breaking changes and migration guide
**And** PR flagged for careful review before merge

### Scenario 5: PRs respect CI/CD pipeline
**Given** Renovate creates dependency update PR
**When** PR is submitted
**Then** CI/CD pipeline triggers automatically
**And** all quality checks run (linting, type checking, tests)
**And** PR cannot be merged until all checks pass
**And** PR shows build status indicating dependency update compatibility

### Scenario 6: PRs include comprehensive update information

**And** PR description shows compatibility status with Python 3.11+

### Scenario 7: Auto-merge disabled requiring manual review
**Given** Renovate creates dependency update PR
**When** all CI/CD checks pass
**Then** PR is NOT automatically merged
**And** PR requires team member approval
**And** team member reviews changelog and compatibility notes
**And** team member manually merges after review

### Scenario 8: Dependency dashboard provides visibility
**Given** Renovate is operational and scanning dependencies
**When** team member views dependency dashboard
**Then** dashboard shows all outdated dependencies

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**Note:** No open implementation questions at this time. Renovate is well-established dependency management bot with clear configuration patterns documented in official Renovate documentation.

**Resolved during planning:**
- ~~"Should we use Renovate or Dependabot?"~~ → Renovate (more flexible batching strategy, better Python/uv support)
- ~~"Should security updates auto-merge?"~~ → No, manual review required for all updates (per PRD-000 principle of deliberate changes)
- ~~"How often should Renovate run?"~~ → Daily (balance freshness with computational overhead)
- ~~"Should we batch all updates?"~~ → No, security updates immediate, minor updates batched weekly, major updates individual
- ~~"Should Renovate be self-hosted or use GitHub App?"~~ → GitHub App (organizational standard per PRD-000 Decision D2)
