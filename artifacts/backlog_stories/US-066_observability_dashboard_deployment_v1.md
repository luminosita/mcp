## User Story
As an **Enterprise Development Team Lead**, I want **real-time observability dashboard showing MCP framework health metrics** so that **I can monitor pilot project stability and troubleshoot issues proactively during 30-day validation period**.

## Description

The MCP framework requires operational visibility for production readiness. During 30-day stability period (per Decision D1), tech leads need real-time insights into:

1. **Resource Cache Performance** - Monitor cache hit rate (target: >70%), identify cache misses requiring optimization
2. **Tool Execution Success Rate** - Track tool invocation failures, latency spikes, error patterns
3. **API Latency Monitoring** - Visualize p50/p95/p99 latencies for Task Tracking API, validate NFR targets met
4. **Active Projects Count** - Track concurrent projects using MCP framework, validate multi-project scalability
5. **Validation Failures** - Monitor artifact validation failures for framework quality metrics

This story delivers Grafana dashboard deployed to monitoring infrastructure, consuming metrics from Prometheus endpoints exposed by MCP Server and Task Tracking microservice. Dashboard accessible 24/7 with alerting for anomalies (latency spikes, error rate increases).

**Dashboard Use Cases:**
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Tech lead checks dashboard daily during stability period to catch issues early
- **Incident Response:** When pilot user reports slowness, tech lead views latency metrics to identify bottleneck
- **Capacity Planning:** Monitor active projects count to anticipate when to scale infrastructure
- **Quality Metrics:** Track artifact validation failure patterns to identify common generator issues

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§6.2: Prometheus Metrics Instrumentation** - MCP Server exposes /metrics endpoint with tool_invocations_total, tool_duration_seconds, active_connections, rag_retrieval_score
  - **Example Code:** §6.2 shows Prometheus metrics definition and instrumentation decorator pattern
- **§6.1: Structured Logging** - structlog configuration with JSON rendering enables log aggregation in Grafana Loki
  - **Example Code:** §6.1 demonstrates structured logging with context variables (tool_name, user_id, request_id)
- **§6.3: Distributed Tracing** - OpenTelemetry integration (optional) provides detailed trace visualization in Grafana Tempo
  - **Example Code:** §6.3 shows span instrumentation for tool invocations

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **§8.1: Poor Error Handling** - Dashboard must distinguish transient errors (network blips) from persistent failures (application bugs)

**Performance Considerations:**
- **Dashboard Query Performance:** Prometheus queries must complete within <5 seconds to avoid UI lag; use aggregation and rate() functions for efficiency

## Functional Requirements
- Grafana dashboard deployed to monitoring infrastructure (Docker Compose or Kubernetes)
- Prometheus data source configured to scrape MCP Server `/metrics` endpoint (30-second interval)
- Dashboard panels:
  - **Resource Cache Hit Rate** - Gauge showing percentage (target: >70%)
  - **Tool Execution Success Rate** - Time series graph showing success vs. error rate per tool
  - **API Latency Percentiles** - Time series graph showing p50/p95/p99 latencies for Task Tracking API endpoints
  - **Active Projects Count** - Gauge showing current concurrent projects
  - **Tool Invocation Rate** - Time series graph showing requests per second per tool
  - **Validation Failure Rate** - Time series graph showing artifact validation failures per generator
- Alert rules:
  - **High Latency Alert:** p95 latency >500ms for >5 minutes
  - **Error Rate Alert:** Error rate >5% for >2 minutes
  - **Cache Performance Alert:** Cache hit rate <50% for >10 minutes
- Dashboard accessible via HTTPS with authentication (Grafana admin credentials)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Availability:** Dashboard accessible 24/7 during pilot period (>99.5% uptime target)
- **Performance:** Dashboard loads within 3 seconds, metric queries complete within 5 seconds
- **Security:** Dashboard requires authentication (Grafana admin password), HTTPS enabled for web access
- **Scalability:** Prometheus retains 30 days of metrics data, auto-compaction for storage efficiency

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** Reference patterns-tooling.md and patterns-architecture.md for implementation standards.

### Implementation Guidance

**Technology Stack:**

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- **patterns-tooling.md:** Use Taskfile command (`task observability:start`) to start Grafana+Prometheus stack, `task observability:stop` to shut down
- **patterns-architecture.md:** Follow Docker Compose structure (docker-compose.observability.yml) for service definitions
- **patterns-validation.md:** Validate Grafana dashboard JSON provisioning files against schema

**Note:** Treat patterns-*.md content as authoritative - supplement with story-specific Grafana dashboard configuration.

### Technical Tasks

**Infrastructure Tasks:**
1. Create Docker Compose configuration for Grafana + Prometheus (docker-compose.observability.yml)

3. Configure Prometheus retention policy (30 days, auto-compaction)
4. Deploy Grafana with persistent storage volume (dashboard configurations, user sessions)
5. Configure HTTPS for Grafana web UI (TLS certificate, reverse proxy if needed)

**Dashboard Configuration Tasks:**
1. Create Grafana dashboard JSON provisioning file (version-controlled in Git)
2. Implement Resource Cache Hit Rate panel (Prometheus query: `rate(cache_hits[5m]) / rate(cache_requests[5m]) * 100`)
3. Implement Tool Execution Success Rate panel (Prometheus query: `rate(tool_invocations_total{status="success"}[5m]) / rate(tool_invocations_total[5m]) * 100`)
4. Implement API Latency Percentiles panel (Prometheus query: `histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(tool_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))` for p95)
5. Implement Active Projects Count panel (Prometheus query: `count(count by (project_id) (task_tracking_requests))`)
6. Implement Tool Invocation Rate panel (Prometheus query: `sum by (tool_name) (rate(tool_invocations_total[5m]))`)
7. Implement Validation Failure Rate panel (Prometheus query: `rate(validation_failures_total[5m])`)

**Alerting Configuration Tasks:**
1. Define Grafana alert rule: High Latency Alert (p95 >500ms for >5 minutes)
2. Define Grafana alert rule: Error Rate Alert (>5% for >2 minutes)
3. Define Grafana alert rule: Cache Performance Alert (<50% hit rate for >10 minutes)
4. Configure alert notification channel (email or Slack webhook)
5. Test alert firing and notification delivery

**Documentation Tasks:**
1. Create dashboard access guide (URL, authentication credentials, navigation)
2. Document alert response procedures (what to do when alert fires)
3. Create troubleshooting guide for common dashboard issues (metrics not appearing, query timeout)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Dashboard Deployment and Accessibility
**Given** Grafana and Prometheus deployed via Docker Compose
**When** Tech lead navigates to https://grafana.localhost (or configured URL)
**Then** Grafana login page loads within 3 seconds
**And** Login with admin credentials succeeds
**And** MCP Framework Dashboard visible in dashboard list

### Scenario 2: Resource Cache Hit Rate Panel
**Given** MCP Server exposing Prometheus metrics at /metrics endpoint
**When** Dashboard refreshes (default: 30-second interval)
**Then** Resource Cache Hit Rate panel displays current percentage (e.g., "72%")
**And** Time series graph shows hit rate trend over last 6 hours
**And** Gauge turns red if hit rate <50%, yellow if 50-70%, green if >70%

### Scenario 3: Tool Execution Success Rate Panel
**Given** MCP Server instrumenting tool invocations with success/error status
**When** Dashboard loads Tool Execution Success Rate panel
**Then** Panel displays success rate percentage per tool (e.g., "validate_artifact: 98%", "resolve_artifact_path: 100%")
**And** Time series graph shows success rate trend per tool (stacked or separate lines)
**And** Failed tool invocations highlighted in panel

### Scenario 4: API Latency Percentiles Panel
**Given** Task Tracking API exposing latency histogram metrics
**When** Dashboard loads API Latency Percentiles panel
**Then** Panel displays p50, p95, p99 latencies for API endpoints (e.g., "GET /tasks/next: p50=50ms, p95=120ms, p99=180ms")
**And** Time series graph shows latency percentiles over time
**And** NFR target line (p95 <200ms) overlaid on graph for comparison

### Scenario 5: Active Projects Count Panel
**Given** Task Tracking API tracking project_id in requests
**When** Dashboard loads Active Projects Count panel
**Then** Panel displays current count of concurrent projects (e.g., "5 active projects")
**And** List of project IDs shown (e.g., "ai-agent, alpha, beta, gamma, delta")
**And** Gauge turns yellow if count >5 (approaching scalability limit)

### Scenario 6: High Latency Alert Firing
**Given** Alert rule configured: p95 latency >500ms for >5 minutes
**When** Task Tracking API experiences latency spike (p95 = 600ms sustained for 6 minutes)
**Then** Grafana alert fires and status changes to "Alerting"
**And** Notification sent to configured channel (email or Slack)
**And** Alert message includes: "High Latency Alert: Task Tracking API p95 latency 600ms (threshold: 500ms)"
**And** Dashboard panel highlights latency spike in red

### Scenario 7: Error Rate Alert Firing
**Given** Alert rule configured: Error rate >5% for >2 minutes
**When** MCP Server tools fail at 8% error rate for 3 minutes (e.g., database connection issues)
**Then** Grafana alert fires and status changes to "Alerting"
**And** Notification sent to configured channel
**And** Alert message includes: "Error Rate Alert: Tool invocation errors 8% (threshold: 5%)"
**And** Dashboard panel shows error rate spike

### Scenario 8: Dashboard Data Retention
**Given** Prometheus retention policy: 30 days
**When** Tech lead queries metrics from 29 days ago
**Then** Dashboard displays historical data (e.g., latency metrics from last month)
**And** Query completes within 5 seconds
**And** When querying 31 days ago, Prometheus returns "no data" (data purged)

### Scenario 9: Dashboard Persistence Across Restarts
**Given** Grafana deployed with persistent volume for /var/lib/grafana
**When** Grafana container restarted (e.g., `docker-compose restart grafana`)
**Then** Dashboard configurations preserved (no data loss)
**And** User sessions, alert rules, data sources remain configured
**And** Dashboard loads immediately after restart (no re-provisioning required)

## Implementation Tasks Evaluation

**Purpose:** Determine if this backlog story should be decomposed into separate Implementation Tasks (TASK-XXX artifacts) per SDLC Guideline v1.3 Section 11.

**Decision:** No Tasks Needed

**Rationale:**
- **Story Points:** 5 SP (CONSIDER per decision matrix - moderate complexity but straightforward implementation)
- **Developer Count:** Single developer (infrastructure engineer or backend engineer with ops experience)
- **Domain Span:** Single domain (infrastructure deployment only - no backend code changes)
- **Complexity:** Medium - Grafana and Prometheus well-documented, Docker Compose setup straightforward
- **Uncertainty:** Low - clear deployment pattern, dashboard provisioning via YAML/JSON configuration
- **Override Factors:** None - no cross-domain changes, no unfamiliar tech, low security criticality (internal monitoring tool)

**Justification for No Tasks:** While 5 SP suggests "CONSIDER" decomposition, the straightforward nature (configure and deploy existing tools), single developer execution, and lack of cross-domain complexity make task decomposition unnecessary overhead. Implementation can proceed as cohesive unit within single sprint.

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**Question 1:** Should Grafana dashboard be deployed to pilot project infrastructure or separate monitoring cluster?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Co-located deployment simpler but monitoring unavailable if pilot infrastructure fails; separate cluster more reliable but adds complexity
- **Recommendation:** Use co-located deployment for pilot phase (simplicity); migrate to separate monitoring cluster for production

**Question 2:** What alert notification channel should be used (email, Slack, PagerDuty)?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Email simple but may be missed during off-hours; Slack better visibility but requires integration setup; PagerDuty overkill for pilot
- **Recommendation:** Use Slack webhook for pilot phase (team already uses Slack); escalate to PagerDuty for production 24/7 on-call

**Question 3:** Should Grafana Loki (log aggregation) be included in this story or deferred?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Loki provides centralized log search complementing metrics; adds deployment complexity and storage requirements
- **Recommendation:** Defer Loki to future story; use structured logging to local files for pilot phase, migrate to Loki if log volume becomes unmanageable

No open implementation questions requiring spikes or ADRs. All technical approaches clear from Implementation Research and PRD.
