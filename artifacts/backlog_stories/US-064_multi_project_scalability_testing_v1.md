## User Story
As an **Enterprise Development Team Lead**, I want **validation that MCP framework supports 5 concurrent projects without resource conflicts or performance degradation** so that **I can confidently expand to multiple pilot projects after stability period**.

## Description

The MCP framework is designed for multi-project use (per PRD-006 §User Personas - Sarah managing 5-10 concurrent projects). Before expanding beyond initial AI Agent MCP Server pilot, we must validate scalability with realistic concurrent load:

**Test Scenario:** 5 independent projects (ai-agent-mcp-server, project-alpha, project-beta, project-gamma, project-delta) using shared MCP framework simultaneously.

**Validation Goals:**
1. **Resource Isolation** - Verify projects access correct SDLC patterns, generators, templates without cross-project leakage
2. **ID Uniqueness** - Confirm Task Tracking microservice assigns unique IDs across all 5 projects (zero collisions)
3. **Performance Degradation** - Measure latency/throughput with 5 concurrent projects vs. single-project baseline; validate <10% degradation
4. **Database Isolation** - Verify project_id filtering prevents cross-project data access
5. **Cache Efficiency** - Confirm resource cache hit rate >70% under multi-project load (shared resources benefit from caching)

This story delivers automated scalability test suite that simulates 5 concurrent projects executing SDLC workflows (epic generation, PRD creation, story breakdown), validates isolation guarantees, and measures performance degradation.

## Implementation Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

**Technical Patterns Applied:**
- **§2.3: Database Connection Pooling** - Validate pool_size=20 supports 5 concurrent projects (4 connections/project average); monitor connection exhaustion
  - **Performance Target:** Zero connection timeout errors under concurrent load
- **§8.2 Anti-Pattern 2: Storing State in Server Instance Variables** - Multi-project stress test verifies no in-memory state leakage between projects
  - **Validation:** Each project's task queue isolated via Redis (externalized state)
- **§3.1: Horizontal Scalability** - Test validates stateless MCP Server design supports scaling to 3 replicas for load distribution

**Anti-Patterns Avoided:**
- **§8.2: Server Instance State** - Multi-project test confirms all state externalized to PostgreSQL/Redis (no instance variable contamination)

**Performance Considerations:**
- **§2.3: PostgreSQL HNSW Index Performance** - Validate similarity search remains performant with 5× document volume (multiple projects' artifacts)
- **§2.4: Redis Cache Efficiency** - Confirm cache hit rate improves with multi-project load (shared resources amortize cache misses)

## Functional Requirements
- Automated scalability test suite simulating 5 concurrent projects
- Test scenarios:
  - Concurrent ID reservation (50 total requests across 5 projects, verify uniqueness)
  - Concurrent resource loading (5 projects loading sdlc-core.md simultaneously, verify cache efficiency)
  - Concurrent task tracking operations (5 projects querying/updating tasks, verify isolation)
  - Concurrent artifact storage (5 projects storing artifacts, verify file path isolation)
- Performance baseline measurement (single project) vs. multi-project measurement
- Validation report: project isolation status (pass/fail), ID collision count (must be zero), performance degradation percentage, cache hit rate

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:** Test suite completes within 15 minutes for 5 concurrent projects
- **Reliability:** Deterministic results - same infrastructure state produces <5% variance
- **Isolation:** Zero cross-project data leakage (task data, ID assignments, artifacts)
- **Performance:** <10% degradation in latency for 5 concurrent projects vs. single-project baseline

## Technical Requirements

**HYBRID CLAUDE.md APPROACH:** Reference patterns-testing.md and patterns-tooling.md for implementation standards.

### Implementation Guidance

**Technology Stack:**
- **asyncio.gather()** - Python async concurrency for simulating 5 projects in parallel
- **pytest-asyncio** - Async test framework for concurrent test execution
- **PostgreSQL transaction isolation** - SERIALIZABLE level prevents ID collisions
- **Project fixtures** - Test fixtures generating 5 independent project contexts (project_id, database schemas, task queues)

**Concurrency Strategy:**
```python
# Simulate 5 projects executing workflows concurrently
projects = ["ai-agent", "alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"]
results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    execute_workflow(project_id) for project_id in projects
])
# Validate zero ID collisions across all results
```

**References to Implementation Standards:**
- **patterns-tooling.md:** Use Taskfile command (`task test:scalability`) to execute multi-project tests
- **patterns-testing.md:** Follow async test fixtures for MCP Server client instances (one per project), PostgreSQL test database with realistic data volume
- **patterns-typing.md:** Strict typing for ScalabilityTestResult Pydantic models (project_id: str, latency_ms: float, id_collisions: int)
- **patterns-validation.md:** Input validation for project configuration (valid project_id, unique IDs)

**Note:** Treat patterns-*.md content as authoritative - supplement with story-specific scalability test implementation.

### Technical Tasks

**Backend Tasks:**
1. Implement project simulation framework (5 independent MCP clients with unique project_id)
2. Implement concurrent ID reservation stress test (10 requests/project × 5 projects = 50 total)
3. Implement concurrent resource loading test (all 5 projects load sdlc-core.md, patterns-*.md simultaneously)
4. Implement concurrent task tracking test (each project queries/updates tasks, validate isolation)
5. Implement performance baseline measurement (single project workflow execution)
6. Implement multi-project performance measurement (5 concurrent projects, same workflow)
7. Calculate performance degradation percentage (compare multi-project vs. baseline latencies)
8. Generate validation report (project isolation pass/fail, ID collision count, degradation %, cache metrics)

**Database Tasks:**
1. Create test database schema with project_id foreign keys for isolation
2. Populate test database with realistic data (1000 tasks × 5 projects = 5000 total)
3. Validate database query performance under multi-project load (no N+1 query issues)

**Infrastructure Tasks:**
1. Configure MCP Server with production-equivalent resource limits (CPU, memory)
2. Deploy PostgreSQL with connection pooling configuration (pool_size=20, max_overflow=10)
3. Deploy Redis cache instance for shared resource caching

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Concurrent ID Reservation Without Collisions
**Given** Task Tracking microservice with ID management endpoint
**When** Scalability test spawns 5 concurrent projects, each requesting 10 US IDs (50 total requests)
**Then** All 50 requests complete successfully with unique IDs (US-001 through US-050, no duplicates)
**And** Database transaction logs show SERIALIZABLE isolation enforced
**And** Zero ID collision errors in validation report

### Scenario 2: Project Data Isolation
**Given** 5 projects (ai-agent, alpha, beta, gamma, delta) with independent task databases
**When** Project "ai-agent" queries `GET /tasks/next?project=ai-agent&status=pending`
**Then** Only tasks with `project_id = "ai-agent"` returned (zero leakage from alpha/beta/gamma/delta)
**And** Validation confirms all 5 projects have strictly isolated data
**And** Cross-project data access attempts return empty results (not errors)

### Scenario 3: Resource Cache Efficiency Under Multi-Project Load
**Given** 5 projects loading shared resources (sdlc-core.md, patterns-core.md)
**When** Scalability test executes concurrent resource loading requests
**Then** First request (cache miss) loads from disk (50ms latency)
**And** Subsequent 4 requests (cache hit) load from Redis (<10ms latency)
**And** Overall cache hit rate >80% (4/5 requests hit cache)
**And** Cache efficiency report confirms shared resource benefit

### Scenario 4: Performance Degradation <10%
**Given** Baseline measurement: Single project executes epic generation workflow (latency: 2000ms)
**When** 5 concurrent projects execute same epic generation workflow simultaneously
**Then** Average latency for 5 concurrent projects ≤ 2200ms (10% degradation threshold)
**And** p95 latency for 5 concurrent projects ≤ 2400ms
**And** Validation report shows degradation percentage ≤ 10%

### Scenario 5: Database Connection Pool Adequacy
**Given** PostgreSQL connection pool configured with pool_size=20, max_overflow=10
**When** 5 concurrent projects execute database-intensive workflows (task tracking, ID management)
**Then** Zero connection timeout errors logged
**And** Connection pool utilization report shows max connections used ≤ 25 (within pool capacity)
**And** No database query failures due to connection exhaustion

### Scenario 6: Artifact Storage Isolation
**Given** 5 concurrent projects storing generated artifacts
**When** Each project calls `store_artifact` with different artifact IDs (EPIC-001 through EPIC-005)
**Then** Artifacts stored in project-specific paths (`artifacts/ai-agent/EPIC-001`, `artifacts/alpha/EPIC-001`, etc.)
**And** Cross-project artifact access attempts return 404 Not Found
**And** Validation confirms zero file path collision

### Scenario 7: Horizontal Scaling Validation (Optional - NFR-Scalability-02)
**Given** MCP Server deployed with 3 replicas behind load balancer
**When** 5 concurrent projects distribute requests across replicas
**Then** Each replica handles subset of requests (roughly 33% traffic per replica)
**And** Zero stateful routing issues (all replicas stateless, externalized state to Redis/PostgreSQL)
**And** Performance degradation with 3 replicas ≤ 5% vs. single replica (load balancer overhead)

## Implementation Tasks Evaluation

**Purpose:** Determine if this backlog story should be decomposed into separate Implementation Tasks (TASK-XXX artifacts) per SDLC Guideline v1.3 Section 11.

**Decision:** No Tasks Needed

**Rationale:**
- **Story Points:** 5 SP (CONSIDER per decision matrix - moderate complexity but straightforward implementation)
- **Developer Count:** Single developer (backend engineer with testing expertise)
- **Domain Span:** Single domain (backend testing only - no frontend, infrastructure deployment minimal)
- **Complexity:** Medium - pytest-asyncio and asyncio.gather() well-documented, concurrency patterns from US-063 reusable
- **Uncertainty:** Low - clear validation criteria, similar to US-063 benchmark implementation
- **Override Factors:** None - no cross-domain changes, no unfamiliar tech, moderate security criticality

**Justification for No Tasks:** While 5 SP suggests "CONSIDER" decomposition, the straightforward nature (extend US-063 benchmark framework with multi-project fixtures), single developer execution, and lack of cross-domain complexity make task decomposition unnecessary overhead. Implementation can proceed as cohesive unit within single sprint.

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**Question 1:** Should scalability test use real SDLC workflows (epic generation, PRD creation) or simplified test operations?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Real workflows provide realistic load but increase test execution time; simplified operations faster but may miss real-world bottlenecks
- **Recommendation:** Use real workflows for comprehensive validation, optimize test data volume to keep execution within 15 minutes

**Question 2:** What constitutes acceptable performance degradation variance (e.g., if baseline is 2000ms, is 2100ms degradation 5% or 10% considering measurement variance)?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** Statistical variance means degradation measurement has margin of error; need clear threshold accounting for variance
- **Recommendation:** Use average of 3 runs for baseline and multi-project measurements; apply 5% statistical tolerance to 10% target (degradation >15% = FAIL, <15% = PASS)

**Question 3:** Should horizontal scaling validation (3 MCP Server replicas) be included in this story or deferred?
- **Marker:** [REQUIRES TECH LEAD]
- **Context:** NFR-Scalability-02 mentions horizontal scaling for ≥20 projects (future phase), but validating 3-replica setup now reduces risk later
- **Recommendation:** Include optional horizontal scaling test (Scenario 7) if time permits within 5 SP estimate; defer to future story if not

No open implementation questions requiring spikes or ADRs. All technical approaches clear from Implementation Research and PRD.
