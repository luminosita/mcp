# User Story: Container Security Scanning in CI/CD Pipeline

## Metadata
- **Story ID:** US-027
- **Title:** Container Security Scanning in CI/CD Pipeline
- **Type:** Feature
- **Status:** Draft
- **Priority:** High - Critical for production security posture
- **Parent PRD:** PRD-000
- **Parent High-Level Story:** HLS-005 (Containerized Deployment Enabling Production Readiness)
- **Functional Requirements Covered:** FR-13 (security aspect), HLS-005 Definition of Done requirement
- **Informed By Implementation Research:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_implementation_research.md

## User Story
As a DevOps engineer deploying containerized applications to production,
I want automated vulnerability scanning of container images in the CI/CD pipeline,
So that I can detect and remediate security vulnerabilities before deployment, maintaining a secure production environment.

## Description
Integrate container image vulnerability scanning into the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline using Trivy (Aqua Security's open-source scanner). Every container build (feature branches and release branches) is automatically scanned for known CVEs in OS packages, application dependencies, and base images. Critical and high-severity vulnerabilities block deployment, while medium/low vulnerabilities generate warnings for team review.

This story completes the HLS-005 Definition of Done requirement: "Container security scanning integrated in CI/CD pipeline" and extends US-026 (Automated Container Build) with security validation.

## Functional Requirements
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities on every build (all branches)
- Detect CVEs in OS packages, Python dependencies, and base images
- Block deployment on critical or high-severity vulnerabilities
- Generate SARIF reports uploadable to GitHub Security tab
- Display scan results in CI/CD pipeline output
- Configure severity thresholds (CRITICAL, HIGH block; MEDIUM, LOW warn)
- Scan both locally built images and published registry images
- Integrate with GitHub Advanced Security (if available)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Vulnerability scan completes within 2 minutes
- **Reliability:** Scanner detects >95% of known CVEs (industry standard for Trivy)
- **Accuracy:** False positive rate <5% (standard Trivy performance)
- **Freshness:** Vulnerability database updated daily via Trivy auto-update
- **Visibility:** Scan results visible in PR comments and GitHub Security tab

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Guidance

Add security scanning job to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

**Scanner Choice:** Trivy (recommended)
- Industry-standard open-source scanner (Aqua Security)
- Comprehensive CVE database (OS packages, application dependencies, IaC misconfigurations)
- Fast scanning (<2 minutes for typical Python containers)
- SARIF output for GitHub Security integration
- No external service dependencies (runs in GitHub Actions)

**Scan Job:**
```yaml
scan-container:
  name: Container Security Scan
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [build-container]
  permissions:
    contents: read
    security-events: write  # For SARIF upload
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      with:
        image-ref: 'ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}'
        format: 'sarif'
        output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
        severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM,LOW'
        exit-code: '1'  # Fail on vulnerabilities
        ignore-unfixed: true  # Ignore vulnerabilities without fixes

    - name: Upload Trivy results to GitHub Security tab
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
      if: always()
      with:
        sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'

    - name: Generate vulnerability summary
      if: failure()
      run: |
        echo "❌ Container security scan failed - vulnerabilities detected"
        echo "View details in GitHub Security tab"
```

**Severity Policy:**
- **CRITICAL/HIGH:** Fail build (exit-code: 1) - blocks deployment
- **MEDIUM/LOW:** Log warning, continue (reported in Security tab)
- **Unfixed vulnerabilities:** Ignored by default (no remediation available)

**Scanning Strategy:**
- **Feature branches:** Scan to provide feedback, don't block merge (informational)
- **Release branches:** Scan with strict blocking on CRITICAL/HIGH
- **Published images:** Scheduled daily scans of latest registry images (separate workflow)

### Alternative: Grype Scanner
If Trivy performance is insufficient, consider Grype (Anchore):
```yaml
- name: Scan with Grype
  uses: anchore/scan-action@v3
  with:
    image: 'ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}'
    fail-build: true
    severity-cutoff: high
```

### GitHub Security Integration
Upload SARIF results to GitHub Security tab for centralized vulnerability management:
- Enables security dashboard view
- Tracks vulnerability trends over time
- Integrates with Dependabot alerts
- Provides remediation guidance

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Clean image passes scan
**Given** container image built with no known vulnerabilities
**When** security scan executes in CI/CD pipeline
**Then** scan completes successfully within 2 minutes
**And** pipeline continues to deployment stage
**And** scan results uploaded to GitHub Security tab

### Scenario 2: Critical vulnerability blocks deployment
**Given** container image contains critical CVE (CVSS >9.0)
**When** security scan executes on release branch
**Then** scan job fails with clear error message
**And** deployment blocked (pipeline fails)
**And** vulnerability details visible in PR comment and Security tab
**And** remediation guidance provided (upgrade package X to version Y)

### Scenario 3: Medium vulnerability logs warning
**Given** container image contains medium severity CVE (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
**When** security scan executes on feature branch
**Then** scan logs warning but does not fail
**And** vulnerability reported in GitHub Security tab for tracking
**And** team can review and decide on remediation timeline

### Scenario 4: Scan results visible in Security tab
**Given** security scan completed (success or failure)
**When** navigating to GitHub repository Security tab
**Then** vulnerability findings displayed in Security Overview
**And** CVE details include severity, affected package, and fix version
**And** Historical scan results available for trend analysis

## Implementation Tasks Evaluation

**Decision:** No Tasks Needed

**Rationale:**
- **Story Points:** 2 SP - Straightforward GitHub Actions integration
- **Developer Count:** Single developer
- **Complexity:** Low - Using established GitHub Actions marketplace action (Trivy)
- **Uncertainty:** Low - Well-documented Trivy integration pattern
- **Configuration:** Minimal - Standard SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Trivy vulnerability scanner added to GitHub Actions workflow

- [ ] Documentation updated with security scanning policy
- [ ] Manual test: Inject known vulnerability, verify detection and blocking
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] All acceptance criteria validated

## Additional Information
**Suggested Labels:** security, container, ci-cd, vulnerability-scanning, trivy
**Estimated Story Points:** 2 (Fibonacci scale)
**Dependencies:**
- US-026 (Automated Container Build) completed - Provides container images to scan
- US-020 (Containerfile) completed - Provides container build definition

**Related Stories:**
- US-026: Automated Container Build (provides images to scan)
- US-008: Automated Dependency Management (complements with Python package CVE detection via Renovate)
- US-025: Staging Validation (validates deployment of scanned images)

**Security Benefits:**
- **Shift-left security:** Detect vulnerabilities before production deployment
- **Compliance:** Meet security audit requirements for vulnerability management
- **Reduced attack surface:** Block known CVEs from reaching production
- **Visibility:** Centralized vulnerability tracking in GitHub Security tab

## Open Questions & Implementation Uncertainties

**No open questions.** Trivy is industry-standard scanner with extensive GitHub Actions documentation. SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab is well-established pattern.

**Potential Customizations (Post-MVP):**
- Configure custom vulnerability ignore list for accepted risks (e.g., `trivy.yaml` with ignore policies)
- Add Slack/email notifications for critical vulnerabilities
- Scheduled scans of published images (daily cron job)
- Integration with external SIEM/security platforms
