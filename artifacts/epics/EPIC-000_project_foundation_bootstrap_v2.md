# Epic: Project Foundation & Bootstrap

## Metadata
- **Epic ID:** EPIC-000
- **Status:** Draft
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Parent Product Vision:** VIS-001
- **Parent Initiative:** INIT-001 (Production-Ready AI Agent Infrastructure)
- **Owner:** Tech Lead
- **Target Release:** Q1 2025 (Weeks 1-4)
- **Informed By Business Research:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_business_research.md

## Epic Statement
As a development team member, I need standardized production-ready project infrastructure so that I can start building features immediately without setup friction and deploy with confidence.

## Parent Artifact Context

**Parent Product Vision:** VIS-001: AI Agent MCP Server Vision
- **Link:** /artifacts/product_visions/VIS-001_product_vision_v1.md
- **Vision Capability:** Foundation infrastructure enabling rapid development and deployment of AI agent capabilities

**Parent Initiative:** INIT-001: Production-Ready AI Agent Infrastructure
- **Link:** /artifacts/initiatives/INIT-001_AI_Agent_MCP_Infrastructure_v3.md
- **Initiative Contribution:** Establishes foundation infrastructure that enables all subsequent epics (EPIC-001 through EPIC-005) and directly supports KR2 (Time-to-Production Reduction: <2 weeks)

## Business Value
Project foundation infrastructure is the critical enabler for all subsequent development work. Without a solid foundation, feature development faces constant friction from inconsistent environments, manual deployment processes, and lack of automation. This epic delivers the scaffolding that allows the entire team to move quickly and safely.

### User Impact
Development team members benefit from:
- **Immediate Productivity:** New team members can begin contributing within hours, not days, through automated environment setup
- **Confidence in Deployments:** Automated validation catches integration errors before they reach production, reducing stress and rework
- **Focus on Value:** Developers spend time building features, not fighting infrastructure or debugging environment differences
- **Consistent Experience:** Standardized structure and workflows reduce cognitive load when switching between tasks

### Business Impact
- **Accelerated Time-to-Market:** Reduces time-to-first-deployment from weeks to days (supports INIT-001 KR2: <2 weeks time-to-production)
- **Team Scalability:** Enables rapid onboarding of additional engineers without linear training overhead
- **Quality Assurance:** Automated build validation reduces integration defects by catching issues early
- **Risk Reduction:** Repeatable deployment processes minimize human error in production releases
- **Foundation Investment:** Establishes patterns that accelerate all subsequent epics (EPIC-001 through EPIC-005)

## Problem Being Solved
Starting a new infrastructure project presents a critical bootstrapping challenge. Development teams face numerous foundational decisions and setup tasks that must be completed before any feature work can begin:

- **Environment Inconsistency:** Developers experience "works on my machine" failures due to inconsistent development environments
- **Manual Deployment Friction:** Lack of automated build and deployment pipelines creates bottlenecks and increases error risk
- **Scattered Knowledge:** Project structure, workflow conventions, and setup instructions exist only in individual developer knowledge
- **Integration Failures:** Without continuous integration, code incompatibilities surface late in development cycles
- **Onboarding Overhead:** New team members face multi-day setup processes with extensive manual configuration

These foundational gaps directly impact INIT-001's strategic objective to "deploy agentic AI systems in weeks instead of months." Without addressing foundation concerns upfront, every feature epic will carry infrastructure debt that compounds over time.

**Market Context:** Per business research, production deployment patterns for MCP infrastructure are scarce, with teams making critical architectural decisions without established patterns. This creates "inconsistent implementations and potential security or reliability issues" (Business Research ยง3.1, Gap 1). Establishing strong foundation patterns positions the project as a reference architecture.

## Business Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_business_research.md

**Market Insights Applied:**

- **Capability Recommendation (ยง4.1):** Foundation infrastructure capabilities that enable rapid development and deployment
- **Competitive Context:** Address inconsistent implementations observed in market by establishing standardized patterns

## Scope

### In Scope
- **Repository Structure Establishment:** Create standardized directory hierarchy, naming conventions, and organizational patterns that support scalable development
- **Core Framework Setup:** Establish application architecture patterns, dependency management, and module organization ready for feature implementation
- **Development Environment Configuration:** Provide automated environment setup enabling developers to achieve working development environment in under 30 minutes
- **CI/CD Pipeline Foundation:** Implement automated build, test, and validation workflows that run on every code change
- **SDLC Workflow Establishment:** Define and document standard development lifecycle processes including branching strategy, code review, and release management
- **Application Skeleton:** Create main entry point and core application structure that serves as template for feature development
- **Development Standards Documentation:** Document coding standards, contribution guidelines, and architectural decisions

### Out of Scope
- **Feature Implementation:** No business features (tool integrations, authentication, knowledge access) - deferred to EPIC-001 through EPIC-005
- **Production Infrastructure Provisioning:** Cloud resource provisioning and production environment setup deferred to deployment epics
- **Security Hardening:** Advanced security features (rate limiting, audit logging, penetration testing) deferred to EPIC-003
- **Observability Platform Integration:** Metrics collection, distributed tracing, and monitoring deferred to EPIC-004
- **End-User Documentation:** User-facing documentation and API references deferred to feature epics

## User Stories (High-Level)

[PRELIMINARY - to be refined in PRD phase]

1. **Development Environment Setup:** As a new developer joining the team, I want automated environment setup so that I can begin contributing within my first day without manual configuration overhead

2. **Automated Build Validation:** As a developer committing code, I want automated build and test execution so that I receive immediate feedback on integration issues before they impact other team members

3. **Standardized Project Structure:** As a developer navigating the codebase, I want consistent directory organization and naming conventions so that I can quickly locate relevant code and understand system architecture

4. **Continuous Integration Pipeline:** As a development team, we need automated integration testing on every change so that we maintain code quality and catch regressions early

5. **Development Workflow Documentation:** As a team member, I want clear documentation of development processes so that I follow consistent practices for branching, code review, and deployment

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic Level)

### Criterion 1: Rapid Environment Setup
**Given** a new developer with access to the repository
**When** they follow documented setup instructions
**Then** they achieve a working development environment in under 30 minutes without manual troubleshooting

### Criterion 2: Automated Build Success
**Given** a developer commits code to a feature branch
**When** the CI/CD pipeline executes
**Then** automated builds, linting, and tests run successfully with results visible within 5 minutes

### Criterion 3: Framework Readiness
**Given** a developer begins implementing a new feature
**When** they examine the application skeleton and framework structure
**Then** they find clear extension points, documented patterns, and working examples requiring minimal boilerplate

### Criterion 4: Development Standards Clarity
**Given** a team member preparing to contribute code
**When** they review development documentation
**Then** they understand branching strategy, code review process, testing requirements, and style conventions without ambiguity

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Environment Setup Time** | <30 minutes from clone to working dev environment | Developer surveys during onboarding, automated timing of setup scripts |
| **CI/CD Pipeline Reliability** | >95% successful builds on clean branches | Pipeline success rate tracking over 30-day rolling window |
| **Framework Readiness** | 100% of feature epics (EPIC-001 through EPIC-005) can begin without infrastructure blockers | Epic planning reviews confirming no foundation dependencies |
| **Team Onboarding Velocity** | New developers merge first meaningful contribution within 2 days | Time tracking from access grant to first merged PR |
| **Development Standards Compliance** | >90% of PRs pass review without standards violations | Code review data analysis for standards-related feedback |

## Dependencies & Risks (Business Level)

### Epic Dependencies
- **Depends On:** None (this is the foundational epic - first to execute)
- **Blocks:** All feature epics (EPIC-001, EPIC-002, EPIC-003, EPIC-004, EPIC-005) - feature development cannot begin without foundation infrastructure

**Critical Path Impact:** As the first epic in the initiative, any delays in EPIC-000 cascade to all downstream epics. Foundation completion is the gating factor for team scaling and feature velocity.

### Business Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Foundation Work Delays Feature Start** | Medium | High | Allocate dedicated 4-week phase with clear scope boundaries. Use proven frameworks and infrastructure-as-code patterns rather than custom solutions. Conduct early platform team engagement to identify potential blockers. |
| **Insufficient Platform Team Capacity** | Medium | High | Engage platform team in sprint planning early. Identify specific areas requiring platform expertise (CI/CD pipeline configuration, container orchestration setup). Establish regular sync meetings to maintain alignment. |
| **Scope Creep Beyond Foundation Concerns** | Medium | Medium | Maintain strict boundary: foundation only, no feature implementation. Use predefined "out of scope" list as decision filter. Conduct weekly scope reviews with tech lead. |
| **Technology Selection Delays** | Low | Medium | Prefer proven, widely-adopted tools over emerging technologies. Limit technology evaluation to essential decisions (build system, container runtime). Document decision rationale using lightweight ADRs. |
| **Inadequate Team Onboarding Documentation** | Low | High | Create documentation in parallel with implementation, not as afterthought. Validate documentation with fresh team member unfamiliar with setup. Include screenshots, troubleshooting sections, and common error resolutions. |

**Note:** Technical dependencies, architecture decisions, and implementation risks are deferred to PRD phase (transition phase where technical research is introduced).

## Effort Estimation
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Estimated Story Points:** [ESTIMATED] 40-60 SP (smaller than typical epic due to focused 4-week scope)
- **Estimated Duration:** 4 weeks (1 month)
- **Team Size:** 2 Senior Backend Engineers (full-time), 0.5 Technical Writer (part-time)

**Estimation Rationale:** Foundation work typically represents 10-15% of total project effort for greenfield projects. Given INIT-001 allocates 12 months and 80-120 SP for subsequent feature epics, 40-60 SP for foundation setup aligns with industry norms. Two senior engineers for 4 weeks provides sufficient capacity for infrastructure setup, documentation, and validation.

## Milestones

## Open Questions

**Business-Level Questions:**

1. **Foundation Investment vs. Feature Velocity:** What is the acceptable balance between time invested in foundation quality and urgency to begin feature development? Should we target minimum viable foundation (2-3 weeks) or comprehensive foundation (4-5 weeks)?

2. **Organizational Platform Alignment:** Are there mandatory organizational platform standards (CI/CD, container orchestration, deployment tooling) that must be adopted, even if they extend the foundation timeline?

3. **Team Onboarding Priority:** Should we optimize foundation for rapid onboarding of new team members (more documentation, simpler setup) or for experienced team productivity (more automation, advanced tooling)?

**Note:** Technical decisions (container runtime selection, monorepo vs multi-repo, CI/CD platform choice, Python version policy, dependency management tools) will be addressed in PRD phase through collaboration between PM and Tech Lead.
