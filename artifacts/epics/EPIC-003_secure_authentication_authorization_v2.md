## Epic Statement

As a security-conscious enterprise organization, I need production-grade authentication and authorization for AI agent infrastructure so that only authorized users can access MCP servers and tools, with comprehensive audit logging for compliance and security incident investigation.

[Derived from Product Vision - Key Capability #4]

---

## Business Value

This epic addresses **Enterprise Security Patterns Gap** identified in Product Vision where existing MCP implementations delegate authentication entirely to developers without providing reference implementations for common enterprise patterns. By providing production-grade security integration, we enable enterprise adoption and differentiate from protocol-focused implementations.

### User Impact

[Extracted from Product Vision §4 - Capability 4]

**For Security Teams:**
- Enforce consistent authentication, authorization, and audit policies across MCP server deployments
- Integrate with existing enterprise identity providers (SSO, SAML, OIDC)
- Monitor all agent activity through comprehensive audit logs
- Reduce security review time by leveraging pre-built, audited security patterns

**For Platform/DevOps Teams:**
- Deploy MCP servers with confidence in production environments
- Leverage familiar auth patterns (OAuth, JWT, API keys) without custom implementation
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) aligned with organizational policies
- Reduce security incidents through built-in best practices

**For End Users:**
- Seamless authentication using enterprise credentials (SSO)
- Fine-grained control over which tools agents can access
- Transparency into agent activity through audit logs

### Business Impact

[Derived from Product Vision Success Metrics and Initiative OKRs]

**Quantified Outcomes:**
- **Zero Security Incidents:** <0.1% error rate with zero security incidents (Initiative KR4)
- **Enterprise Adoption Enabler:** Unblocks 50+ production deployments by addressing security requirements
- **Security Review Time Reduction:** Reduce security review time from weeks to days by providing audited reference implementation
- **Compliance Readiness:** Enable SOC 2, ISO 27001 compliance through comprehensive audit logging

**Contribution to Initiative OKRs:**
- **KR1 (Production Deployments):** Security is gate for enterprise adoption—enables path to 50+ deployments
- **KR4 (Security Incident Rate):** Directly measures success—zero incidents, <0.1% error rate
- **Strategic Differentiator:** Addresses market gap #2 (Enterprise Security Patterns) from Product Vision §3.1

## Problem Being Solved

[Extracted from Product Vision - Market Gap Analysis §3.1, Gap 2: Enterprise Security Patterns]

**Current Gap:**

MCP implementations delegate authentication entirely to developers without providing reference implementations for common enterprise authentication patterns. This creates critical barriers:

**Security Team Friction:**
- Struggle to enforce consistent authentication, authorization, and audit policies across MCP server deployments
- Each team implements custom security, creating potential vulnerabilities
- No established patterns for OAuth 2.0, JWT validation, or API key management
- Compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001) difficult without standardized audit logging

**Enterprise Adoption Barriers:**
- Security reviews block production deployments due to lack of enterprise auth integration
- Custom security implementations require extensive review and penetration testing
- Missing SSO integration prevents adoption in enterprises with centralized identity management
- No audit trail for agent activity creates compliance gaps

**Development Team Overhead:**
- Engineers spend weeks implementing authentication from scratch
- Security expertise required for every deployment
- Maintenance burden for custom auth code
- Inconsistent security patterns across teams

**Strategic Opportunity:**

[From Product Vision §3.1]

Security reference architecture with production-ready authentication middleware and example integration with enterprise identity providers (Okta, Auth0, Azure AD) would address compliance and security requirements blocking enterprise adoption. This is a key differentiator vs. protocol-only implementations.

## User Stories (High-Level)

[PRELIMINARY - to be refined in PRD phase]

### Story 1: JWT Authentication
**As a developer**, I want to authenticate to MCP server using a JWT token so that I can securely access agent tools from my application.

**Value:** Enables programmatic access with industry-standard auth method

### Story 2: API Key Management
**As an administrator**, I want to generate and manage API keys for service accounts so that I can grant automated systems access to MCP server.

**Value:** Supports automation and CI/CD integration

### Story 3: RBAC Configuration
**As a security administrator**, I want to define roles with specific tool permissions so that I can enforce least-privilege access control.

**Value:** Reduces security risk through granular permissions

### Story 4: SSO Integration
**As an enterprise IT admin**, I want to integrate MCP server with Okta SSO so that users authenticate with enterprise credentials and I maintain centralized access control.

**Value:** Enterprise adoption enabler, reduces credential sprawl

### Story 5: Audit Log Review
**As a security auditor**, I want to query comprehensive audit logs of all agent activity so that I can investigate security incidents and ensure compliance.

**Value:** Compliance requirement, incident response capability

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic Level)

### Criterion 1: Multiple Auth Methods Functional
**Given** MCP server is deployed with authentication enabled
**When** user authenticates using JWT, API key, or OAuth 2.0
**Then** authentication succeeds for valid credentials, fails for invalid credentials, with appropriate error messages

**Validation:** Automated authentication tests, manual testing with all auth methods

### Criterion 2: RBAC Enforced at Tool Level
**Given** user has role with limited tool permissions (e.g., read-only role)
**When** user/agent attempts to invoke restricted tool
**Then** request is denied with permission error, audit log records denial

**Validation:** Permission boundary testing with restricted roles, automated RBAC tests

### Criterion 3: Comprehensive Audit Logging
**Given** agent performs actions (auth, tool invocations, errors)
**When** security team queries audit logs
**Then** all events are logged with user, timestamp, action, result, IP, and no logs are missing or tampered

**Validation:** Log completeness verification, tamper detection testing, SIEM integration test

### Criterion 4: Zero Critical Security Findings
**Given** security audit and penetration testing complete
**When** security team reviews findings
**Then** no critical vulnerabilities found (injection, auth bypass, privilege escalation, etc.)

**Validation:** External security audit, penetration testing report

## Open Questions

[Require security/engineering/compliance input before PRD phase]

1. **SSO Provider Priority:** Which SSO providers should we prioritize? Okta, Auth0, Azure AD confirmed—others needed? (Customer validation)

2. **RBAC Granularity:** Tool-level permissions sufficient, or need resource-level (e.g., specific JIRA projects)? (Complexity vs. precision trade-off)

3. **Audit Log Retention:** How long should audit logs be retained? 90 days, 1 year, 7 years? (Compliance requirement varies by industry)

4. **Secrets Management:** Require KMS (Vault, AWS KMS) for MVP, or document for Phase 2? (Security vs. scope trade-off)

5. **Security Audit Timing:** Schedule audit in Month 4-5 or after all features complete in Month 6? (Risk mitigation vs. iteration time)

6. **Rate Limiting Strategy:** Per-user limits only, or also per-tool, per-IP, global? (Granularity vs. complexity)

7. **SAML Support:** Required for MVP (some enterprises mandate SAML), or defer to Phase 3? (Enterprise requirement validation needed)
