## Epic Statement

As a developer or DevOps engineer deploying MCP servers, I need automated generation of deployment configurations (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD) following organizational best practices and security requirements so that I can deploy confidently without mastering infrastructure-as-code syntax or risking misconfigurations.

[Derived from Product Vision - Key Capability #3]

---

## Business Value

This epic addresses **CI/CD automation** as a common use case for development agents and the **integration fragmentation** problem by providing standardized deployment capabilities. By automating deployment configuration generation, we reduce deployment errors, accelerate time-to-production, and embed security best practices automatically.

### User Impact

[Extracted from Product Vision §4 - Capability 3]

**For Developers:**
- Request deployment configurations without mastering Kubernetes, Docker, or CI/CD YAML syntax
- Deploy MCP servers quickly with pre-validated, secure configurations
- Avoid common deployment pitfalls (security misconfigurations, resource limits, health checks)
- Focus on application logic rather than infrastructure plumbing

**For DevOps Engineers:**
- Establish standardized deployment patterns across teams
- Embed security best practices and organizational policies in generated configs
- Reduce configuration drift and ad-hoc deployments
- Accelerate onboarding of new services with consistent deployment approach

**For Security Teams:**
- Ensure deployments follow security baselines (no root containers, resource limits, secrets management)
- Reduce deployment-related security incidents through validated configurations
- Enforce compliance requirements in generated configurations

### Business Impact

[Derived from Product Vision Success Metrics and Initiative OKRs]

**Quantified Outcomes:**
- **Deployment Configuration Time:** Reduce from 4-8 hours (manual YAML authoring) to <30 minutes (agent-generated with review)
- **Configuration Accuracy:** Generated configurations pass security validation >95% of time (Product Vision success indicator)
- **Adoption Without Modification:** Users adopt generated configurations without modification >70% of time (Product Vision success indicator)
- **Deployment Incident Reduction:** Reduce deployment-related incidents by 50% through validated, secure configurations

**Contribution to Initiative OKRs:**
- **KR2 (Time-to-Production):** Accelerates deployment setup, contributes to <2-week time-to-production target
- **KR4 (Security & Error Rate):** Reduces deployment misconfigurations contributing to error rate
- **Strategic Differentiator:** Demonstrates integration fragmentation solution—standardized deployment capabilities

## Problem Being Solved

[Extracted from Product Vision - Problem Statement, Pain Point 1: Integration Fragmentation]

**Current Pain Point:**

Development teams waste time building redundant deployment configurations as each service requires custom Kubernetes manifests, Dockerfiles, and CI/CD pipelines. This creates duplicated effort and inconsistent deployment patterns.

**User Friction Today:**

1. **High Learning Curve:** Developers must master Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, and CI/CD tools—steep learning curve delays deployments

2. **Configuration Errors:** Manual YAML authoring prone to errors—typos, missing health checks, incorrect resource limits cause production incidents

3. **Security Misconfigurations:** Easy to overlook security best practices—root containers, missing security contexts, exposed secrets

4. **Inconsistent Patterns:** Each team reinvents deployment configs—no standardization leads to maintenance burden and knowledge silos

5. **Time Sink:** 4-8 hours per service for deployment configuration—time not spent on application logic

**Strategic Opportunity:**

[From Product Vision §4.1 Strategic Rationale]

CI/CD automation is common use case for development agents. Addresses integration fragmentation by providing standardized deployment capabilities. Demonstrates MCP value proposition for infrastructure automation.

## Scope

### In Scope

1. **Docker Configuration Generation:**
   - Multi-stage Dockerfile with security best practices
   - Non-root user configuration
   - Minimal base images (Python slim, Alpine)
   - Build optimization (layer caching, .dockerignore)
   - Health check definitions

2. **Kubernetes Manifest Generation:**
   - Deployment manifest (replicas, resource limits, probes)
   - Service manifest (ClusterIP, LoadBalancer, NodePort)
   - ConfigMap for application configuration
   - Secret references (not secret values—external secrets management)
   - Security context (non-root, read-only filesystem, capabilities drop)
   - Resource requests and limits (CPU, memory)

3. **Helm Chart Generation (Optional):**
   - Basic Helm chart structure
   - Values.yaml with configurable parameters
   - Template parameterization for multi-environment deployments

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Templates:**
   - GitHub Actions workflow (build, test, deploy)
   - GitLab CI pipeline template
   - Generic pipeline structure (extensible for other CI/CD systems)
   - Container image build and push
   - Kubernetes deployment automation

5. **Security & Best Practices:**
   - Container security scanning (Trivy, Snyk integration)
   - Non-root container enforcement
   - Resource limit enforcement (prevent resource exhaustion)
   - Network policies (namespace isolation)
   - Secrets management guidance (external secrets, sealed secrets)

6. **Configuration Templates:**
   - Environment-specific configs (dev, staging, prod)
   - Configuration validation (syntax, security policies)
   - Documentation generation (deployment guide, architecture diagram)

7. **Agent Integration:**
   - MCP tool schema for deployment config generation
   - Natural language requests (e.g., "Generate Kubernetes deployment for MCP server")
   - Context-aware generation (infer parameters from MCP server config)
   - Interactive refinement (user feedback loop for config adjustments)

### Out of Scope (Explicitly Deferred)

1. **Deployment Execution:** No automatic deployment—generate configs only, user reviews and applies. Defer deployment automation to Phase 2.

2. **Multi-Cloud Support:** Kubernetes-only for MVP—no AWS ECS, GCP Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps. Defer to Phase 2 based on demand.

3. **Advanced Helm Features:** No Helm hooks, dependencies, or advanced templates—basic chart only. Defer to advanced Kubernetes epic.

4. **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):** No Terraform generation for cloud resources—Kubernetes manifests only. Defer to IaC epic.

5. **Service Mesh Configuration:** No Istio, Linkerd configs—basic Kubernetes networking only. Defer to service mesh integration epic.

6. **GitOps Integration:** No ArgoCD/Flux integration—standard CI/CD only. Defer to GitOps epic.

7. **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):** No Kubernetes operator patterns or CRDs—standard resources only.

## Open Questions

[Require DevOps/security input before PRD phase]

1. **Helm vs. Raw Manifests:** Generate Helm charts or raw Kubernetes YAML? (Flexibility vs. simplicity trade-off—Helm has adoption but adds complexity)

2. **CI/CD Platform Priority:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI confirmed—need Jenkins, CircleCI, others? (Customer validation)

3. **Security Scanner:** Trivy (open-source, container focus) or Checkov (infrastructure-as-code focus) or both? (Coverage vs. integration complexity)

4. **Configuration Customization:** How much parameterization? Opinionated defaults vs. full customization? (Usability vs. flexibility)

5. **Deployment Automation:** Keep out of scope for MVP, or add basic deployment execution? (Security vs. convenience trade-off)

6. **Multi-Cloud Support:** Kubernetes-only sufficient, or need AWS ECS/GCP Cloud Run templates? (Scope validation with customers)

7. **GitOps Integration:** Defer to future or include basic ArgoCD/Flux support? (Adoption pattern in target customers)
