## Problem Being Solved

[Extracted from Product Vision - Market Gap Analysis §3.1, Gap 1: Production Deployment Guides]

**Current Gap:**

While MCP protocol documentation is comprehensive, practical guidance on production observability patterns is scarce. Topics like observability architecture, monitoring strategy, and performance optimization lack established patterns.

**DevOps Team Friction:**

1. **Blind Production Deployments:** Teams deploy MCP servers without visibility into health, performance, or errors—flying blind in production

2. **Slow Incident Response:** When issues occur, no tracing or context to debug—MTTR measured in hours or days instead of minutes

3. **Performance Unknowns:** No visibility into latency, throughput, resource usage—can't optimize or capacity plan

4. **No SLA Validation:** Can't measure uptime, availability, or performance against SLAs—no confidence in production readiness

5. **Alert Fatigue or Alert Blindness:** Either no alerts (miss issues) or too many noisy alerts (ignore important ones)

**Enterprise Adoption Barriers:**

- Production teams refuse to deploy systems without observability ("we can't support what we can't see")
- Security teams require audit trails and anomaly detection
- Compliance requires uptime reporting and incident documentation
- No established observability patterns creates integration burden for each customer

**Strategic Opportunity:**

[From Product Vision §3.1 and §5.1]

Comprehensive production deployment blueprints with reference implementations for observability would accelerate adoption and improve reliability. First-mover advantage in establishing observability patterns. This is a production-first design differentiator vs. protocol-focused implementations.

## Scope

### In Scope

1. **Core Metrics (RED Method):**
   - **Rate:** Requests per second (total, per tool, per user)
   - **Errors:** Error rate, error types, error distribution

   - Trace correlation across service boundaries
   - Performance hotspot identification

3. **Error Tracking & Alerting:**
   - Structured error logging with stack traces

2. **Advanced Analytics:** ML-based anomaly detection, predictive alerting deferred to Phase 3

3. **Custom Metrics SDK:** Extensible metrics framework for customer-defined metrics deferred—predefined metrics only for MVP

4. **Cost Tracking:** Detailed cost attribution per user/team deferred to Phase 3 (Month 7-12)—basic cost metrics in Initiative EPIC-005

5. **APM Deep Profiling:** Application Performance Monitoring with code-level profiling deferred—span-level tracing sufficient for MVP

6. **Multi-Region Observability:** Global dashboard aggregating metrics across regions deferred to multi-region deployment epic

## User Stories (High-Level)

[PRELIMINARY - to be refined in PRD phase]

### Story 1: Real-Time Health Dashboard
**As a DevOps engineer**, I want to view a real-time dashboard showing MCP server health (requests/sec, error rate, latency) so that I can monitor production systems at a glance.

**Value:** Operational visibility, confidence in production health

### Story 2: Distributed Trace Debugging
**As an SRE**, I want to view distributed traces when debugging slow requests so that I can identify performance bottlenecks (e.g., slow PM API, slow knowledge retrieval).

**Value:** Faster incident resolution, performance optimization

### Story 3: Error Alert Notification
**As an on-call engineer**, I want to receive PagerDuty alerts when error rate exceeds threshold so that I can respond to incidents proactively before users are impacted.

**Value:** Proactive incident response, reduced MTTR

### Story 4: Tool Usage Analytics
**As a product manager**, I want to see which tools are most frequently used so that I can prioritize development and understand feature adoption.

**Value:** Data-driven product decisions, prioritization insights

### Story 5: SLA Compliance Reporting
**As a platform lead**, I want to generate monthly SLA reports (uptime %, P95 latency) so that I can demonstrate reliability to stakeholders and customers.

**Value:** Stakeholder confidence, compliance documentation

## Open Questions

**Business-Level Questions:**

1. **Metrics Retention Policy:** How long should we retain metrics? 30 days (minimal cost), 90 days (standard), 1 year (comprehensive historical analysis)? (Storage cost vs. historical analysis and compliance needs)

2. **Alerting Channels Priority:** Which alerting integrations are required for MVP? PagerDuty confirmed as priority. Should we also include Slack, email, Opsgenie based on customer requirements? (Integration scope and customer validation)

3. **Dashboard Customization Approach:** Should we allow customers to customize dashboards (higher flexibility, support complexity) or provide fixed, well-designed templates (simpler, lower support burden)? (Flexibility vs. support/maintenance trade-off)

4. **Multi-Tenancy Metrics Isolation:** How should we isolate metrics for different customers/teams in enterprise deployments? What level of segregation is required for compliance and operational clarity? (Enterprise deployment model and data governance)

5. **Logging Integration Scope:** Is basic structured logging sufficient for MVP, or do customers require full log aggregation (ELK, Splunk) integration? (Scope decision for MVP vs. Phase 2 based on customer requirements)

6. **Observability Cost Budget:** What is the acceptable infrastructure cost increase for observability? (Prometheus storage, tracing backend, log retention) This impacts retention policies and sampling rates. (Cost-benefit analysis for different deployment scales)

**Note:** Technical decisions (tracing backend selection - Jaeger vs Tempo, trace sampling strategy, metrics cardinality management, instrumentation approaches) will be addressed in PRD phase through collaboration between PM and Tech Lead.
