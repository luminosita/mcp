## Epic Statement

As an enterprise software development team member (product manager or developer), I need AI agents to access and understand our project management tools (JIRA, Linear, Asana) so that I can query project status, task dependencies, and workload without switching contexts or manually copying data between systems.

[Derived from Product Vision - Key Capability #1]

---

## Business Value

This epic addresses the **Context Access Barrier** identified in Product Vision where AI agents lack access to project-specific information that developers and product managers routinely use. By integrating with project management systems, agents can provide context-aware responses grounded in actual project state rather than generic advice.

### User Impact

[Extracted from Product Vision §4 - Capability 1]

**For Product Managers:**
- Instantly query project status, sprint progress, and team capacity without navigating JIRA/Linear dashboards
- Ask agents to identify blockers, dependencies, and at-risk deliverables
- Generate status reports and stakeholder updates automatically from current project state

**For Developers:**
- Query assigned tasks, priorities, and dependencies without leaving IDE or terminal
- Ask agents to find related issues, pull requests, and documentation for current work
- Receive context-aware recommendations based on project requirements and architectural decisions

**For Teams:**
- Reduce context-switching overhead (average 23 minutes per switch per UC Irvine study referenced in Product Vision template example)
- Improve cross-team coordination through shared agent access to project information
- Accelerate onboarding by enabling new team members to query project context conversationally

### Business Impact

[Derived from Product Vision Success Metrics and Initiative OKRs]

**Quantified Outcomes:**
- **Context-Switching Reduction:** Reduce time spent switching to project management tools from 30+ minutes/day to <5 minutes/day (85% reduction)
- **Query Response Time:** Answer project status questions in <10 seconds vs. 3-5 minutes manual lookup (95% faster)
- **Adoption Rate:** 70% of users with project management tool access use integration weekly (Product Vision success indicator)
- **Agent Context Accuracy:** Agents correctly retrieve relevant issues for user queries >90% of time (Product Vision success indicator)

**Contribution to Initiative OKRs:**
- **KR1 (Production Deployments):** Project management integration is table-stakes capability for enterprise adoption—enables path to 50+ deployments
- **KR2 (Time-to-Production):** Pre-built integration reduces custom development time by 40 hours (Product Vision metric)
- **KR5 (Tool Integration Efficiency):** Demonstrates <2-hour integration time vs. 40-hour custom build

## Problem Being Solved

[Extracted from Product Vision - Problem Statement, Pain Point 2: Context Access Barriers]

**Current Pain Point:**

AI agents lack mechanisms to access project management systems containing:
- Current sprint/milestone status and deliverables
- Task assignments, priorities, and dependencies
- Project-specific requirements and acceptance criteria
- Team workload and capacity planning
- Historical context from previous sprints/projects

**User Friction Today:**

1. **Manual Context Provision:** Developers must copy-paste issue descriptions, requirements, and project context into agent conversations—time-consuming and error-prone

2. **Stale Information:** Agents work with outdated information provided earlier rather than current project state—leading to incorrect recommendations

3. **Limited Agent Value:** Without project context, agents provide generic advice not tailored to actual project constraints, requirements, or priorities—reducing adoption

4. **Fragmented Workflows:** Users toggle between IDE/terminal, AI agent interface, and project management tool—losing flow state and productivity

**Strategic Opportunity:**

[From Product Vision §4.1 Strategic Rationale]

Project management integration consistently identified as high-value capability for development-focused agents. This epic directly addresses the context access barrier by giving agents visibility into organizational project information, ensuring recommendations align with current project state and priorities.

## Scope

### In Scope

1. **Project Management Tool Connectors:**
   - JIRA integration (query issues, sprints, boards, users)
   - Linear integration (query issues, projects, teams, workflows)
   - Generic REST API connector (extensibility for other tools)

2. **Query Capabilities:**
   - Retrieve issue details by ID, key, or search query
   - Search issues by assignee, status, priority, labels, sprint
   - Query sprint/milestone information (scope, progress, burndown)
   - Retrieve project hierarchies (epics, stories, subtasks)
   - Query team member workload and capacity

3. **Agent Context Integration:**
   - Tool schemas defining available project management operations
   - Natural language query translation (agent interprets user questions)
   - Contextual result formatting (readable responses vs. raw JSON)

4. **Authentication & Security:**
   - OAuth 2.0 support for JIRA/Linear
   - API token authentication
   - User-level permissions (agents access only what user can access)
   - Audit logging of all project management queries

5. **Documentation & Examples:**
   - Connector configuration guides (JIRA, Linear setup)
   - Agent usage examples (common query patterns)
   - API reference for tool schemas
   - Troubleshooting guide for common integration issues

### Out of Scope (Explicitly Deferred)

1. **Write Operations:** No create/update/delete capabilities—read-only access for MVP to reduce security risk and simplify implementation. Defer to future epic based on customer feedback.

2. **Advanced Analytics:** No burndown charts, velocity calculations, or advanced project analytics—agents return raw data; users interpret. Defer to Phase 2 enhancement.

3. **Custom Fields & Workflows:** Support limited to standard JIRA/Linear fields. Custom field mapping deferred to customer-specific customization.

4. **Real-Time Notifications:** No push notifications or webhooks triggering agent actions. Defer to future multi-agent coordination epic.

5. **Additional Tools:** GitHub Projects, Trello, Monday.com, Asana connectors deferred to Phase 2 based on customer demand validation.

6. **Data Synchronization:** No caching or local sync of project data—real-time queries only. Defer caching to performance optimization epic if needed.

## User Stories (High-Level)

[PRELIMINARY - to be refined in PRD phase]

### Story 1: JIRA Issue Query
**As a developer**, I want to ask an agent "What issues are assigned to me in the current sprint?" so that I can quickly see my work without opening JIRA.

**Value:** Eliminates context switch to JIRA, provides quick work summary

### Story 2: Sprint Status Query
**As a product manager**, I want to ask an agent "What's the status of Sprint 23?" so that I can get instant sprint progress without manually reviewing the board.

**Value:** Accelerates status reporting, enables quick stakeholder updates

### Story 3: Issue Details Retrieval
**As a developer**, I want to ask an agent "Explain PROJ-1234" so that I can understand issue requirements and acceptance criteria conversationally.

**Value:** Contextual understanding without switching tools, clarifies requirements quickly

### Story 4: Dependency Discovery
**As a developer**, I want to ask an agent "What issues block PROJ-1234?" so that I can identify blockers and coordinate with other team members.

**Value:** Surfaces dependencies proactively, improves team coordination

### Story 5: Linear Project Overview
**As a product manager using Linear**, I want to ask an agent "Summarize the Infrastructure project" so that I can get a high-level overview without navigating through Linear.

**Value:** Quick project comprehension, useful for multi-project context switching

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic Level)

### Criterion 1: JIRA Integration Functional
**Given** a user has configured JIRA OAuth credentials
**When** the user asks agent "Show my assigned issues"
**Then** agent queries JIRA API, retrieves user's assigned issues, and returns formatted list with ID, title, status, priority

**Validation:** Manual testing with test JIRA instance, automated integration tests

### Criterion 2: Linear Integration Functional
**Given** a user has configured Linear API token
**When** the user asks agent "What's in the current cycle?"
**Then** agent queries Linear API, retrieves current cycle issues, and returns formatted summary

**Validation:** Manual testing with test Linear workspace, automated integration tests

### Criterion 3: Query Success Rate Exceeds 90%
**Given** agents are deployed in production environments
**When** users issue project management queries (tracked via telemetry)
**Then** >90% of queries return relevant results successfully (no errors, results match user intent based on follow-up queries)

**Validation:** Production telemetry, user satisfaction surveys, error rate monitoring

### Criterion 4: Authentication & Authorization Enforced
**Given** a user has configured project management credentials
**When** agent queries project management tool
**Then** agent only accesses issues/projects the user has permission to view (no privilege escalation)

**Validation:** Security testing with restricted user accounts, permission boundary verification

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| **R1: API Rate Limiting** | High | Medium | Implement aggressive caching (5-minute TTL), rate limit user queries, respect API quotas, provide clear error messages when quota exceeded |
| **R2: API Breaking Changes** | Medium | High | Version API calls explicitly, monitor API changelogs, implement automated integration tests detecting breakage, maintain version compatibility layer |
| **R3: OAuth Complexity** | Medium | Medium | Use well-tested OAuth library, provide detailed setup guides, offer API token alternative (simpler setup), comprehensive error messaging for OAuth failures |
| **R4: Insufficient Permissions** | Medium | Low | Clear documentation on required JIRA/Linear permissions, permission validation during setup, helpful error messages guiding permission troubleshooting |
| **R5: Query Ambiguity** | Medium | Medium | Provide query examples in docs, agent prompt engineering guidance, fallback to clarification questions when query ambiguous |
| **R6: Performance Degradation** | Low | High | Load testing with production-like query volumes, connection pooling, timeout enforcement (10s max), circuit breaker pattern for degraded APIs |

## Open Questions

[Require product/engineering input before PRD phase]

1. **Custom Field Support:** Do we need to support JIRA custom fields in MVP, or is standard field set sufficient? (Impacts scope and timeline)

2. **Write Operations:** Should we defer all write operations (create, update issues) to post-MVP, or is there high-value subset we should include? (Security vs. user value trade-off)

3. **Caching Strategy:** What cache TTL is acceptable? 5-minute cache reduces API calls but may show stale data. (Performance vs. freshness trade-off)

4. **Error Handling UX:** When PM API is down or rate-limited, should agent fail gracefully with explanation, or retry automatically? (User experience decision)

5. **Multi-Project Support:** Should agents query across all projects user has access to, or scope to specific project(s)? (Permission model and performance implications)

6. **Additional PM Tools Priority:** After JIRA/Linear, which PM tool should we prioritize next? (GitHub Projects, Asana, Monday.com, Trello) - Validate with customer development.
