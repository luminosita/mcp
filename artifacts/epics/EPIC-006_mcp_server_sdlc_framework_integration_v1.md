# Epic: MCP Server SDLC Framework Integration

## Metadata
- **Epic ID:** EPIC-006
- **Status:** Draft
- **Priority:** High
- **Parent Product Vision:** VIS-001
- **Parent Initiative:** INIT-001 (AI Agent MCP Infrastructure)
- **Owner:** [Tech Lead]
- **Target Release:** Q2 2025
- **Informed By Business Research:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_business_research.md

## Epic Statement
As an enterprise development team using the AI Agent MCP Server, I need the SDLC framework (artifacts, generators, templates, and validation logic) accessible through MCP resources and tools so that I can efficiently plan and implement projects without maintaining duplicate local files across multiple repositories.

## Parent Artifact Context

**Parent Product Vision:** [VIS-001: AI Agent MCP Server]
- **Link:** `/artifacts/product_visions/VIS-001_AI_Agent_MCP_Server_v1.md`
- **Vision Capability:** This epic implements the core capability of "eliminating integration fragmentation" by standardizing access to SDLC framework components through MCP protocol, enabling reusable planning and implementation workflows across multiple projects.

**Parent Initiative:** [INIT-001: Production-Ready AI Agent Infrastructure]
- **Link:** `/artifacts/initiatives/INIT-001_ai_agent_mcp_infrastructure_v4.md`
- **Initiative Contribution:** This epic bridges EPIC-000 (Project Foundation) and EPIC-001 (Project Management Integration) by demonstrating MCP Server's ability to serve prompts, resources, and tools. It validates the infrastructure established in EPIC-000 through practical usage of MCP capabilities, setting the foundation for EPIC-001's external system integration.

## Business Value
[Strategic positioning as critical validation step between foundation and integration phases]

### User Impact
Development teams benefit from:
- **Centralized Maintenance:** Single source of truth for SDLC framework components eliminates synchronization overhead across projects
- **Consistent Workflows:** Standardized prompts, resources, and tools ensure consistent planning and implementation practices across teams
- **Reduced Context Costs:** MCP resources reduce AI token consumption by ~40-60% compared to loading full local files repeatedly
- **Improved Precision:** Deterministic Python scripts for validation and path resolution eliminate AI inference errors (estimated 85-95% error reduction)

### Business Impact
- **Time-to-Production Acceleration:** Reduce new project setup time from 2-3 days to <4 hours (>80% reduction) by eliminating framework file duplication
- **Framework Maintenance Efficiency:** Reduce framework updates from N×M repository updates to single centralized update (where N = projects, M = framework files)
- **Multi-Language Extensibility:** Enable framework reuse for Go, Rust, and other language projects by separating language-specific resources from core orchestration
- **Token Cost Reduction:** Lower AI API costs by 40-60% through optimized context loading via MCP resources vs. full file loading

## Problem Being Solved
EPIC-000 established a functional MCP Server with example tool implementation, demonstrating technical capability. However, the current SDLC framework (CLAUDE.md orchestration, artifact generators, templates, validation checklists) relies entirely on local file access and AI inference for path resolution, validation, and artifact ID management. This creates several critical issues:

1. **Framework Duplication:** Each new project requires copying CLAUDE.md files, generators, templates, and artifacts, leading to synchronization overhead and version drift
2. **AI Inference Overhead:** Path resolution, validation rules, and artifact ID assignment rely on AI inference, consuming excessive tokens and introducing non-deterministic errors
3. **TODO.md Growth:** Task tracking file grows unbounded with each task, burning unnecessary tokens on every interaction
4. **Maintenance Fragmentation:** Framework updates require manual synchronization across N project repositories
5. **Language Lock-In:** Current Python-specific CLAUDE.md files cannot be reused for Go/Rust projects without significant rework

These issues block efficient scaling to multiple projects and languages, limiting the framework's value proposition as "production-ready infrastructure for enterprise development teams."

## Business Research References

**Primary Research Document:** /artifacts/research/AI_Agent_MCP_Server_business_research.md

**Market Insights Applied:**
- **Gap Analysis (§3.1):** Addresses the M×N scaling problem for tool integration by centralizing framework components as MCP resources, reducing per-project integration cost from 40+ hours to <2 hours
- **Capability Recommendation (§4.1):** Implements "Unified MCP Tool Ecosystem" capability by demonstrating how MCP resources and tools enable framework reusability across projects
- **User Persona (§Appendix A):** Targets "Enterprise Development Team Lead" persona requiring consistent SDLC practices across multiple concurrent projects

**Competitive Context:**
Current MCP implementations focus on protocol compliance and basic tool examples. This epic differentiates by demonstrating advanced MCP usage (resources for framework components, deterministic tools for validation) that delivers quantifiable business value (time-to-production reduction, token cost savings). Establishes competitive advantage through "production-ready framework infrastructure" positioning vs. "protocol-focused implementations."

## Scope

### In Scope
- **MCP Prompts:** Migrate .claude/commands/*.md Claude commands to MCP Server prompts
- **MCP Resources - Hybrid CLAUDE.md Files:**
  - Refactor main CLAUDE.md into two parts: pure orchestrator (remains local) + SDLC workflow instructions (new prompts/CLAUDE/CLAUDE-sdlc.md)
  - Migrate all prompts/CLAUDE/CLAUDE-*.md files (sdlc, core, tooling, testing, typing, validation, architecture) to MCP Server resources
- **MCP Resources - Artifacts:** Migrate artifacts/**/* to MCP Server resources for cross-project reuse
- **MCP Resources - Generators & Templates:** Migrate prompts/*.xml and prompts/templates/*.xml to MCP Server resources
- **MCP Tools - Validation:** Convert generator validation checklists and input classification rules to deterministic Python scripts exposed as MCP tools
- **MCP Tools - Path Resolution:** Convert artifact path resolution logic from CLAUDE.md instructions to Python script (MCP tool)
- **MCP Tools - Task Tracking:** Replace TODO.md file-based tracking with database-backed MCP tool ("Get Next Task" API)
- **MCP Tools - Artifact ID Management:** Replace CLAUDE.md ID tracking with database-backed MCP tool ("Get Next Available ID" and "Reserve ID Set" APIs)
- **Orchestration Update:** Update main CLAUDE.md as orchestrator for MCP Server tools, prompts, and resources (no functionality loss)

### Out of Scope
- **Project Management Integration (EPIC-001):** External system integration (JIRA, Linear, etc.) deferred to next epic
- **Multi-Language Framework Variants:** Go/Rust-specific CLAUDE.md resources deferred to future phase (infrastructure established, variants added later)
- **Advanced Task Analytics:** Task dependency graphs, burndown charts, velocity tracking deferred to EPIC-001
- **Cross-Project Artifact Sharing UI:** Web-based interface for browsing shared artifacts deferred to future phase (CLI/API access only in this epic)

## User Stories (High-Level)

[PRELIMINARY - to be refined in PRD phase]

1. **Story 1:** As a development team lead, I want to start a new project using the SDLC framework without copying files from existing projects so that I avoid version drift and reduce setup time from days to hours
2. **Story 2:** As a framework maintainer, I want to update validation rules or templates in one central location so that all projects using the framework automatically receive updates without manual synchronization
3. **Story 3:** As an AI agent orchestrating SDLC workflows, I want deterministic path resolution and validation tools so that I eliminate inference errors and reduce token consumption by 40-60%
4. **Story 4:** As a project manager, I want to query task status via MCP tool API so that I can track progress without parsing large TODO.md files on every request
5. **Story 5:** As a generator executing artifact creation, I want to request next available artifact IDs from MCP tool so that ID assignment is guaranteed unique across all projects without manual CLAUDE.md updates

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic Level)

### Criterion 1: MCP Resources Migration
**Given** a new project wants to use the SDLC framework
**When** the project configures MCP Server connection with resource access enabled
**Then** all CLAUDE.md files, generators, templates, and shared artifacts are accessible as MCP resources without local file duplication

### Criterion 2: MCP Tools Functional Equivalence
**Given** an AI agent executing SDLC workflow (e.g., epic generation, backlog story creation)
**When** the agent uses MCP tools for path resolution, validation, task retrieval, and ID assignment
**Then** the workflow completes successfully with identical output quality to pre-migration local file approach, demonstrating zero functionality loss

### Criterion 3: Token Cost Reduction
**Given** baseline token consumption measured for 10 typical SDLC workflow executions (epic generation, PRD creation, story breakdown) using local file approach
**When** same 10 workflows execute using MCP resources and tools
**Then** total token consumption is reduced by ≥40% due to optimized context loading and elimination of repeated file parsing

### Criterion 4: Multi-Project Validation
**Given** two concurrent projects (Project A: Python REST API, Project B: Python CLI tool) both using the shared MCP framework
**When** both projects execute parallel workflows (e.g., simultaneous epic generation with ID assignment)
**Then** artifact IDs are guaranteed unique across projects, no resource conflicts occur, and both workflows complete successfully

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Framework Setup Time** | <4 hours for new project (vs. 2-3 days baseline) | Time from repository creation to first artifact generation (tracked via project onboarding survey) |
| **Token Cost Reduction** | ≥40% reduction in AI API costs for typical workflows | Compare token consumption for 10 representative workflows (pre/post migration, measured via API telemetry) |
| **Validation Error Rate** | <5% error rate for path resolution and validation (vs. ~20-30% baseline AI inference errors) | Error tracking in MCP tool execution logs (30-day rolling average) |
| **Framework Update Efficiency** | Single central update vs. N repository updates | Measure time to propagate framework change (e.g., new validation rule) to all active projects |
| **Multi-Project Scalability** | Support ≥5 concurrent projects using shared framework without resource conflicts | Stress test with 5 parallel workflows, monitor for ID collisions, resource contention, error rate |

## Dependencies & Risks (Business Level)

### Epic Dependencies
- **Depends On:** EPIC-000 (Project Foundation & Bootstrap) - Must be completed, as this epic requires functional MCP Server infrastructure established in EPIC-000
- **Blocks:** EPIC-001 (Project Management Integration) - Validates MCP capabilities (prompts, resources, tools) required for external system integration

### Business Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Adoption Resistance from Teams** | Medium | Medium | Early pilot with internal team, demonstrate time savings, provide migration guide with side-by-side comparison, collect feedback and iterate |
| **Framework Complexity Increases Onboarding Friction** | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive documentation, quick-start guide with working examples, video tutorials, office hours for new teams |
| **MCP Resource Performance Bottleneck** | Low | High | Benchmark MCP resource loading vs. local files, implement caching layer if needed, monitor latency in production |
| **Database Dependency Adds Operational Overhead** | Medium | Medium | Use lightweight embedded database (SQLite) for MVP, clear backup/restore procedures, fallback to file-based tracking if database unavailable |
| **Token Cost Reduction Targets Not Met** | Low | Medium | Baseline measurement before migration, incremental optimization (identify highest token consumers first), revise targets if necessary based on data |

**Note:** Technical dependencies (database choice, MCP protocol version compatibility, Python package dependencies) and implementation risks (migration complexity, data consistency) are deferred to PRD phase.

## Decisions Made

**Business-level decisions finalized for EPIC-006. Technical decisions deferred to PRD phase.**

### 1. Pilot Project Selection
**Decision:** The current AI Agent MCP Server project will be used as a PoC for validation of MCP framework migration

**Rationale:** Self-hosting approach where the MCP Server project validates its own framework migration, providing immediate feedback and demonstrating production readiness.

### 2. Migration Timeline - PoC Phase Approach
**Decision:** Advanced PoC Phase - EPIC-006 is Phase 2 of PoC evolution
- **Phase 1:** SDLC planning with MCP Server implementation using local Git repository
- **Phase 2:** Continuation of MCP Server development using itself as a deployed container

**Rationale:** Progressive validation strategy from local development to containerized deployment ensures framework robustness at each maturity level.

### 3. Framework Update Communication
**Decision:** Not an issue since the same team members are actively developing framework and using those same MCP resources (now as shared)

**Rationale:** Single-team development model eliminates communication complexity in PoC phase. Communication processes will be established when expanding to multiple teams in future phases.

### 4. Multi-Language Expansion Priority
**Decision:** Go Lang prioritized for Task tracking tool implementation

**Purpose:** PoC for programming language flexibility, demonstrating framework's multi-language capabilities

**Impact on SDLC:** Requirements Phase artifacts (PRDs, Backlog stories, and other technology-aware artifacts) will use different sets of hybrid `CLAUDE.md` files specific to Go Lang or other programming languages

**Scope:** Strategic Phase artifacts (Vision, Initiative, Epic) remain language-agnostic; Requirements and Implementation phases leverage language-specific resources

### 5. Database Hosting Model
**Decision:** Project-specific database model

**Implementation:**
- Task tracking tool as standalone microservice with its own database
- MCP Server integration via REST API
- Each project maintains independent task tracking database

**Rationale:** Microservice architecture enables independent deployment, scaling, and data isolation between projects while maintaining clean integration boundaries through REST API.
