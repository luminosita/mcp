## Epic Statement

As an enterprise software development team member (developer or product manager), I need AI agents to access and search our organizational documentation and knowledge bases so that I receive answers grounded in company standards, architectural decisions, and project-specific context rather than generic or incorrect responses.

[Derived from Product Vision - Key Capability #2]

---

## Business Value

This epic addresses the **Context Access Barrier** identified in Product Vision where AI agents cannot access organizational knowledge bases, internal documentation, and project-specific information that developers routinely use. By providing semantic search over indexed organizational content, agents deliver contextually accurate responses aligned with internal standards and practices.

### User Impact

[Extracted from Product Vision §4 - Capability 2]

**For Developers:**
- Query internal architectural decisions, coding standards, and best practices without searching wikis/Confluence
- Receive recommendations consistent with organizational patterns and approved technologies
- Access historical context and rationale for technical decisions
- Reduce onboarding time by conversationally querying documentation

**For Product Managers:**
- Query product requirements, user research, and strategic documents without navigating folders
- Ask agents about past decisions, feature rationale, and market context
- Generate summaries of long documents or cross-reference multiple sources

**For Teams:**
- Ensure agent responses align with organizational standards (no generic StackOverflow answers)
- Reduce time spent searching for documentation (average 2+ hours/day per developer)
- Improve knowledge retention and institutional memory accessibility

### Business Impact

[Derived from Product Vision Success Metrics and Initiative OKRs]

**Quantified Outcomes:**
- **Knowledge Retrieval Precision:** >70% precision (users rate answers as relevant) per Product Vision success metric
- **Documentation Search Time Reduction:** Reduce time from 5-10 minutes manual search to <30 seconds agent query (90% reduction)
- **Adoption Rate:** 60% of users with knowledge base access use feature weekly (Product Vision success indicator)
- **Answer Accuracy:** Agents provide contextually accurate responses >80% of time (vs. generic responses without organizational knowledge)

**Contribution to Initiative OKRs:**
- **KR1 (Production Deployments):** Organizational knowledge access is enterprise differentiator—critical for 50+ deployments
- **KR2 (Time-to-Production):** Demonstrates capability addressing key enterprise pain point
- **KR3 (Community Validation):** Knowledge access showcases MCP value proposition—drives GitHub stars

## Problem Being Solved

[Extracted from Product Vision - Problem Statement, Pain Point 2: Context Access Barriers]

**Current Pain Point:**

AI agents lack mechanisms to access organizational knowledge repositories containing:
- Internal wikis (Confluence, Notion, SharePoint)
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- Technical documentation and API references
- Product requirements and user research
- Engineering standards and best practices
- Historical project context and lessons learned

**User Friction Today:**

1. **Generic Responses:** Agents without organizational knowledge provide StackOverflow-style generic answers not tailored to company tech stack, standards, or architectural patterns

2. **Manual Context Provision:** Users copy-paste documentation into agent conversations—time-consuming and hits context window limits

3. **Stale or Incorrect Information:** Agents use outdated training data rather than current organizational documentation—leading to wrong recommendations

4. **Reduced Trust:** Developers don't trust agent responses without organizational grounding—limits adoption and value

5. **Onboarding Friction:** New team members can't query organizational knowledge conversationally—extends ramp-up time

**Strategic Opportunity:**

[From Product Vision §4.1 Strategic Rationale]

Knowledge access directly addresses context barrier by giving agents access to organizational information, ensuring responses align with internal standards and practices. This capability differentiates enterprise MCP infrastructure from consumer AI assistants and protocol-only implementations.

## Scope

### In Scope

1. **Knowledge Source Connectors:**
   - Confluence integration (spaces, pages, attachments)
   - Notion integration (workspaces, databases, pages)
   - Local file system indexing (Markdown, text files, PDFs)
   - Generic HTTP crawler (internal documentation sites)

2. **Indexing & Embedding Pipeline:**
   - Document chunking strategy (preserve context, optimize retrieval)
   - Embedding generation using sentence transformers
   - Vector database storage (Qdrant, Weaviate, or similar)
   - Incremental updates (detect changed documents, re-index)

3. **Semantic Search Capabilities:**
   - Natural language query translation
   - Hybrid search (vector similarity + keyword matching)
   - Relevance scoring and ranking
   - Contextual snippet extraction for agent responses

4. **Retrieval Integration:**
   - MCP tool schema for knowledge queries
   - Retrieved context formatting for agent consumption
   - Source citation (link back to original document)
   - Multi-document aggregation for comprehensive answers

5. **Access Control & Security:**
   - User-level permissions (respect source system permissions)
   - Document-level access control lists (ACLs)
   - Audit logging of knowledge queries
   - PII/sensitive data detection and filtering

6. **Documentation & Examples:**
   - Connector setup guides (Confluence, Notion, filesystem)
   - Indexing strategy recommendations
   - Agent query pattern examples
   - Troubleshooting guide for search quality issues

### Out of Scope (Explicitly Deferred)

1. **Advanced Query Decomposition:** No multi-step reasoning or query decomposition—single-shot retrieval only. Defer to Phase 3 (Month 7+).

2. **Real-Time Indexing:** Document updates indexed on schedule (hourly/daily), not real-time. Defer real-time sync to performance optimization epic.

3. **Additional Knowledge Sources:** GitHub wikis, SharePoint, Google Docs, Dropbox Paper connectors deferred to Phase 2 based on customer demand.

4. **Document Authoring:** No write-back capabilities—read-only knowledge access. Defer to future collaborative editing epic.

5. **Knowledge Graph:** No relationship modeling or entity extraction—flat document retrieval only. Defer to advanced AI features epic.

6. **Multi-Modal Search:** Text-only search; no image, video, or audio indexing. Defer to future enhancement.

7. **Personalization:** No user-specific ranking or learning from feedback. Defer to Phase 3 ML optimization.

## User Stories (High-Level)

[PRELIMINARY - to be refined in PRD phase]

### Story 1: Confluence Document Search
**As a developer**, I want to ask an agent "What's our API versioning policy?" so that I can get instant answers from internal docs without searching Confluence.

**Value:** Eliminates manual wiki search, provides instant policy guidance

### Story 2: ADR Retrieval
**As a developer**, I want to ask an agent "Why did we choose PostgreSQL over MongoDB?" so that I can understand past architectural decisions with full context.

**Value:** Surfaces historical decision rationale, improves understanding

### Story 3: Coding Standards Query
**As a developer**, I want to ask an agent "Show me our Python error handling standards" so that I can write code consistent with team conventions.

**Value:** Ensures code consistency, reduces review cycles

### Story 4: Multi-Document Synthesis
**As a product manager**, I want to ask an agent "Summarize all user research about onboarding" so that I can get consolidated insights without reading 10+ documents.

**Value:** Accelerates research synthesis, improves decision-making

### Story 5: New Hire Onboarding
**As a new team member**, I want to ask an agent "How do I set up my development environment?" so that I can ramp up quickly without bothering teammates.

**Value:** Faster onboarding, reduces team interruption, improves new hire experience

**When** indexing pipeline runs
**Then** all accessible documents are chunked, embedded, and stored in vector database with source metadata

**Validation:** Manual verification of index completeness, automated indexing tests

### Criterion 2: Semantic Search Returns Relevant Results
**Given** a user asks agent a question requiring organizational knowledge
**When** agent queries knowledge base with semantic search
**Then** top 5 retrieved chunks are relevant to query (≥70% precision per success metric)

**Validation:** Test query suite (20+ common questions), user acceptance testing, production telemetry

### Criterion 3: Source Attribution Provided

## Open Questions

[Require product/engineering/security input before PRD phase]

1. **Vector Database Selection:** Qdrant (open-source, self-hosted) vs. Pinecone (managed, simpler) vs. Weaviate? (Infrastructure complexity vs. operational burden trade-off)

2. **Embedding Model:** Use open-source sentence-transformers (free, self-hosted) or OpenAI embeddings (higher quality, cost)? (Cost vs. quality trade-off)

3. **ACL Granularity:** Space-level permissions (simpler) or page-level permissions (more accurate)? (Implementation complexity vs. security precision)

4. **Indexing Frequency:** Hourly, daily, or on-demand refresh? (Freshness vs. resource consumption trade-off)

5. **Chunk Size:** 256, 512, or 1024 tokens per chunk? (Retrieval precision vs. context completeness trade-off—requires experimentation)

6. **PII Filtering Strategy:** Block documents with PII entirely, mask PII in responses, or trust ACLs? (Security vs. usability trade-off—requires legal/compliance input)

7. **Multi-Tenancy:** How do we isolate knowledge bases for different customers/teams? (Enterprise deployment model question)
