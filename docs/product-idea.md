# Product Idea: CLI Context Manager

## Initial Concept

A command-line tool that helps developers manage and optimize context for AI-assisted coding sessions.

## Problem Overview

Developers using AI coding assistants (like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor) often struggle with:
- Context window limitations leading to loss of important information
- Difficulty determining what files/docs to include in context
- Manual, time-consuming process of selecting relevant context
- Context pollution from irrelevant files
- No visibility into token usage before hitting limits

## Target Users

**Primary Persona:** Software developers using AI coding assistants daily
- Experience level: Intermediate to senior developers
- Work environment: Professional software development teams
- Technical proficiency: Comfortable with command-line tools
- Pain point: Spending 15-30 minutes per session manually selecting context files

**Secondary Persona:** Engineering team leads optimizing AI tool adoption
- Responsibility: Improving team productivity with AI tools
- Challenge: Lack of visibility into how team uses AI context effectively
- Need: Best practices and patterns for context management

## Key Capabilities (High-Level)

1. **Context Analysis**: Analyze project structure and suggest relevant files for current task
2. **Token Estimation**: Preview token usage before sending to AI (avoid hitting limits)
3. **Smart Filtering**: Automatically exclude irrelevant files (node_modules, build artifacts, etc.)
4. **Context Presets**: Save and reuse context configurations for common tasks
5. **Collaboration**: Share context patterns across team

## Success Vision

Developers reduce context preparation time from 15-30 minutes to under 2 minutes per session, while improving relevance of included context by 60%+.

## Initial Constraints

- Must work across multiple AI coding platforms
- Command-line interface (no GUI initially)
- Support for major project types (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust)
- Open-source MIT license

## Questions to Explore

- How do we measure "context relevance"?
- What's the right balance between automation and developer control?
- Should we integrate directly with AI tools or remain tool-agnostic?
- How do we handle proprietary/sensitive code in context?
