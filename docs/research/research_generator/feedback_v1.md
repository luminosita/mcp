⏺ Analysis Complete - Seeking Confirmation

  I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the existing research prompts, artifacts, generator templates, and SDLC phase templates. Before proceeding with creating the generic research prompt and template, I
  need to clarify several critical assumptions and design decisions:

  Key Observations from Analysis:

  1. Three Different Research Approaches Identified:
  - Backlog research: Simple prompt, focused on technology analysis (graph databases, Agile practices)
  - MCP research: Included anti-hallucination elements, deeper architectural focus
  - Secrets Management research: Most comprehensive - market segmentation, competitive analysis, strategic recommendations with extensive citations

  2. Critical Gaps in Existing Prompts:
  - No standardized citation requirements across all three
  - Inconsistent research depth and structure
  - Missing validation checklists
  - No anti-hallucination guardrails in backlog/shh prompts
  - Varying levels of human interaction/clarification

  Proposed Research Framework Design Decisions - Please Confirm:

  A. Research Prompt Scope & Human Interaction
  1. Should the research prompt require human inputs upfront (product idea, problem overview, target users, capabilities, product references)?
    - My recommendation: YES - this grounds the research and prevents hallucination
  2. Should the prompt include interactive clarification steps before starting research?
    - My recommendation: YES - include validation of inputs and assumption clarification with required human confirmation

  B. Research Artifact Structure
  Based on SDLC template analysis and the three research examples, I propose the research artifact should include:

  1. Executive Summary (synthesis of findings)
  2. Market & Competitive Analysis (like secrets mgmt research)
  3. Product Capabilities Recommendations organized by:
    - Core functionality
    - Security
    - Architecture
    - Technology stack
    - Testing & observability
    - API/CLI (if applicable)
    - Integration capabilities
    - AI/Agent assistance (if applicable)
  4. Gap Analysis (market gaps, technology gaps)
  5. Implementation Guidelines & Pitfalls
  6. Strategic Recommendations
  7. References (with mandatory citations)

  Is this structure aligned with your vision?

  C. Citation Requirements
  - Should I mandate the same citation format as shown in the secrets management research (Markdown footnotes with [^N] format)?
  - My recommendation: YES - make this a REQUIRED validation criterion

  D. Relationship to SDLC Phases
  The research artifact should inform:
  - Product Vision (problem statement, user personas, success metrics, competitive landscape)
  - Epics (capabilities breakdown, business value)
  - PRDs (functional/non-functional requirements, technical considerations)
  - Backlog Stories (implementation tasks, technical requirements)

  Should the research artifact explicitly map findings to these SDLC phases?

  E. Anti-Hallucination Strategy
  - Require human product input validation before research starts
  - Mandate source citations for all claims
  - Require research plan approval before execution
  - Include final validation checklist

  Is this approach acceptable?

  Questions Needing Your Confirmation:

  1. Confirm research artifact structure outlined in section B above?
  2. Confirm mandatory citation requirements using Markdown footnote format?
  3. Confirm human interaction points: Input validation → Research plan approval → Final artifact delivery?
  4. Should the research prompt include specific instructions for different product categories (CLI tools, SaaS platforms, infrastructure tools, AI/ML products)?
  5. Technology stack recommendations: Should these be mandatory sections or optional based on product type?

  Please review these assumptions and confirm or adjust before I proceed to generate the final outputs.


**Human Response**
A. Research Prompt Scope & Human Interaction
1. YES
2. YES

B. Research Artifact Structure
Structure confirmed. I also confirm that Secrets Mgmt Research is excellent example

C. Citation Requirements
YES - make this a REQUIRED validation criterion

D. Relationship to SDLC Phases
NO 

**Rationale**:
- no need to have explicitly stated SDLC phases, as long as we can comprehensive information for SDLC artifacts creation
- make sure to request abundant set of examples

E. Anti-Hallucination Strategy
Acceptable

Questions Needing Your Confirmation:

1. Confirmed
2. Confirmed
3. Confirmed
4. YES - as add on/appendix section
5. Technology stack recommendations: Mandatory, if applicable
