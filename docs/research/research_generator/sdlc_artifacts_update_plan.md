# Update Plan: sdlc_artifacts_comprehensive_guideline.md

## Document Metadata
- **Target Document:** `docs/research/backlog/sdlc_artifacts_comprehensive_guideline.md`
- **Current Version:** 1.0
- **Proposed Version:** 1.1
- **Date:** 2025-10-10
- **Purpose:** Incorporate findings from Research Split initiative session

---

## Session Findings Summary

This session clarified:
1. **SDLC phases split** (Business vs Implementation)
2. **PRD as bridge artifact** (uses both research types)
3. **Backlog Story categorization** (PRD-derived vs non-PRD-derived)
4. **Research architecture split** (Business Research vs Implementation Research)
5. **Traceability requirements** for non-PRD-derived stories

---

## Proposed Updates

### UPDATE 1: Add SDLC Phase Distinction (New Section 1.8)

**Location:** After Section 1.7 (PRD), before Section 2

**New Section:**

```markdown
### 1.8 SDLC Phases: Business vs Implementation

**Definition:** SDLC artifacts separate into two distinct planning phases with different focus and information needs.

---

#### 1.8.1 Business Phase (Strategic Planning)

**Focus:** Market opportunity, user needs, competitive positioning, product strategy

**Phase Characteristics:**
- **User-Centric:** Focuses on WHAT users need and WHY
- **Implementation-Agnostic:** Avoids specific technology prescriptions
- **Strategic:** Concerned with business value, market fit, positioning
- **Audience:** Product managers, executives, sales, marketing

**Business Phase Artifacts:**
- **Product Vision:** Problem statement, user personas, competitive landscape, success metrics
- **Epics:** Business capabilities, user value, strategic priorities, market justification
- **PRDs (partial):** Functional requirements, business-level NFRs (compliance, enterprise features), user workflows
- **Initiatives:** Strategic themes, market opportunities, roadmap phases
- **High-Level User Stories:** User goals and needs (purely functional, no technical constraints)

**Supporting Research:**
- **Business Research:** Market analysis, competitive intelligence, user personas, gap analysis (market/UX), strategic capabilities (what/why), positioning recommendations

**Example Business-Phase Artifacts:**
```
Initiative: "Increase mobile app engagement by 20%"
├─ Business Research: Market analysis, user pain points, competitive UX gaps
├─ Epic: "Improve push notifications" (business value: retention)
├─ PRD: Functional requirements (what notifications), business NFRs (GDPR compliance)
└─ High-Level Story: "As a user, I want relevant notifications" (no tech details)
```

---

#### 1.8.2 Implementation Phase (Technical Execution)

**Focus:** Architecture, technology, implementation patterns, code

**Phase Characteristics:**
- **Technology-Specific:** Prescribes HOW to build with specific technologies
- **Implementation-Detailed:** Includes code examples, architecture diagrams, performance metrics
- **Operational:** Concerned with scalability, security, observability, testing
- **Audience:** Developers, architects, technical leads, DevOps

**Implementation Phase Artifacts:**
- **Backlog Stories:** Technical implementation approaches, specific scenarios, system behavior
- **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records):** Technology choices, architecture decisions, trade-off analysis
- **Technical Specifications:** Detailed component design, API contracts, data models
- **Implementation Tasks:** Specific technical work with code examples

**Supporting Research:**
- **Implementation Research:** Technology stack analysis, architecture patterns, security/observability/testing patterns, code examples, pitfalls/anti-patterns, build-vs-buy (technical perspective)

**Example Implementation-Phase Artifacts:**
```
Backlog Story: "Implement push notification preferences API"
├─ Implementation Research: REST API patterns, database schema, security (OAuth 2.0 code)
├─ ADR: "Use PostgreSQL for user preferences storage (vs Redis)"
├─ Tech Spec: API endpoints, request/response schemas, error handling
└─ Implementation Tasks: "Create API endpoint [4h]", "Write unit tests [3h]"
```

---

#### 1.8.3 Bridge Artifact: PRD

**Definition:** PRD sits at the boundary between Business and Implementation phases, requiring input from BOTH research types.

**PRD Dual Nature:**
- **Business Inputs:** Market gaps, functional capabilities, strategic NFRs
- **Implementation Inputs:** Technical NFRs (performance targets), technology constraints

**PRD Creation Process:**
1. Load **Business Research**: Extract market gaps, user needs, functional requirements
2. Load **Implementation Research**: Extract technical NFRs (p99 < 200ms), technology constraints
3. **Synthesize**: Product Manager + Tech Lead collaboration
4. **Output**: Comprehensive requirements spanning business goals + technical feasibility

**Example PRD Section:**
```markdown
## Functional Requirements (from Business Research)
- Users can configure push notification preferences
- Preferences grouped by category (marketing, transactional, alerts)
- Changes apply immediately without app restart

## Non-Functional Requirements
**Business-Level NFRs (from Business Research):**
- GDPR compliance: User consent required, opt-out available
- Enterprise requirement: SSO integration for corporate accounts

**Technical NFRs (from Implementation Research):**
- API response time p99 < 200ms
- Support 10,000 concurrent preference updates
- 99.9% availability SLA
```

**Authorship:**
- **Product Manager:** Owns business requirements, strategic NFRs
- **Tech Lead:** Contributes technical NFRs, feasibility assessment
- **Final Approval:** Product Manager (business alignment) + Tech Lead (technical feasibility)
```

---

### UPDATE 2: Expand Section 1.5 (Backlog User Story) with Categories

**Location:** Section 1.5 (Backlog User Story)

**Add After Existing Content:**

```markdown
---

#### 1.5.7 Backlog Story Derivation: PRD vs Non-PRD Sources

**Key Finding:** Not all Backlog Stories derive from PRDs. Multiple categories exist with different traceability requirements.

---

##### Category 1: PRD-Derived Stories (Primary Flow)

**Description:** Stories that directly implement PRD requirements.

**Characteristics:**
- Functional requirements decomposed into implementation tasks
- NFRs refined into specific technical stories
- Clear traceability to parent PRD

**Example:**
```
PRD Requirement: "Users can configure push notification preferences by category"
    ↓ (decomposes into)
Backlog Story: "As a user, I want to enable/disable marketing notifications"
```

**Traceability Format:** Standard parent-child linkage in backlog tool

---

##### Category 2: Emergent Implementation Requirements

**Description:** Technical requirements discovered during implementation that weren't visible during PRD creation.

**Characteristics:**
- Directly supports a PRD feature/requirement
- Necessary for proper implementation
- Not explicitly stated in PRD

**Examples:**
- "Add database index on user_id column for query performance"
- "Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for external API calls"
- "Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures"

**Threshold for PRD Creation:** None (trace to parent PRD)

**Research Source:** **Implementation Research** (architecture patterns, best practices, pitfalls)

**Traceability Format:**
```
Story: Implement circuit breaker pattern for notification service API
Justification: Necessary to implement PRD-XXX requirement robustly
Reference: Implementation Research §6.1 - Anti-pattern: Cascade Failures
Implementation Guidance: Implementation Research §4.7 - Circuit Breaker Code Example
```

---

##### Category 3: Technical Debt & Refactoring

**Description:** Improvements to existing code/architecture that don't add user-visible features.

**Characteristics:**
- Not in any PRD (doesn't add features)
- Improves code quality, performance, or maintainability
- May enable future PRD features

**Examples:**
- "Refactor authentication service to use dependency injection"
- "Migrate from REST polling to WebSocket for real-time updates"
- "Extract shared validation logic into reusable library"

**Threshold for PRD Creation:** None

**Research Source:** **Implementation Research** (anti-patterns §6.2, refactoring patterns)

**Traceability Format:**
```
Story: Refactor notification service to use dependency injection
Justification: Improves testability; enables future PRD-YYY (A/B testing framework)
Reference: Implementation Research §6.2 - Anti-pattern: God Service
```

---

##### Category 4: Bug Fixes

**Description:** Correcting defects in existing functionality.

**Characteristics:**
- Not in PRD (bugs discovered post-deployment)
- Restores intended behavior from original PRD requirement
- May reveal missing NFRs from original PRD

**Examples:**
- "Fix: Push notifications not respecting user timezone"
- "Fix: Notification preferences not persisting after app restart"

**Threshold for PRD Creation:** None

**Research Source:** Minimal (primarily references original PRD/Tech Spec for intended behavior)

**Traceability Format:**
```
Story: Fix notification preferences not persisting
Justification: Restores PRD-XXX intended behavior (section 4.2 - Persistence Requirements)
Root Cause: Missing database transaction commit (Implementation Research §6.4 - Transaction Pitfalls)
```

---

##### Category 5: Minor Product Enhancements (No PRD Required Below Threshold)

**Description:** Small user-facing improvements that don't warrant full PRD process.

**Characteristics:**
- User-facing (unlike technical debt)
- Small enough that creating full PRD is overhead
- May accumulate into larger themes over time

**Examples:**
- "Add keyboard shortcut Cmd+K for notification search"
- "Display timestamp in user's local timezone instead of UTC"
- "Add 'Copy to clipboard' button for notification IDs"

**Threshold for PRD Creation:**
- **Complexity:** > 5 story points OR > 2 weeks effort → **Requires PRD**
- **User Impact:** Changes core workflow → **Requires PRD**
- **Strategic:** Affects product positioning or roadmap → **Requires PRD**

**Research Source:**
- **Business Research:** UX gaps (§3.2), competitive UX patterns
- **Implementation Research:** UI patterns, best practices

**Traceability Format:**
```
Story: Add keyboard shortcut Cmd+K for notification search
Justification: Addresses UX gap (Business Research §3.2 - Keyboard Navigation); Low complexity (2 SP)
No PRD Required: Below complexity threshold (< 5 SP, does not change core workflow)
```

---

##### Category 6: UX/UI Improvements

**Description:** Design iterations based on user feedback or usability testing.

**Characteristics:**
- Improves existing features (already has PRD)
- May be significant enough to warrant PRD update/addendum
- Often data-driven (analytics, user feedback)

**Examples:**
- "Improve notification list: add filtering and sorting controls"
- "Redesign notification preferences UI for better discoverability"
- "Add loading skeleton screens for notification list"

**Threshold for PRD Creation:**
- **Complexity:** > 5 story points OR > 2 weeks effort → **Requires PRD update**
- **User Impact:** Changes core workflow → **Requires PRD update**

**Research Source:**
- **Business Research:** UX gaps, competitive UX patterns
- **Implementation Research:** UI component libraries, performance optimization

**Traceability Format (Below Threshold):**
```
Story: Add loading skeleton screens for notification list
Justification: Improves PRD-XXX perceived performance; Low complexity (3 SP)
Reference: Implementation Research §4.5 - UI Performance Patterns
```

**Traceability Format (Above Threshold):**
```
Story: Redesign notification preferences UI (8 SP)
Justification: Improves PRD-XXX based on usability testing feedback (34% users couldn't find preferences)
PRD Update Required: Yes - Update PRD-XXX section 5.3 (UI Requirements)
```

---

##### Category 7: Operational/DevOps Stories

**Description:** Infrastructure, monitoring, deployment improvements.

**Characteristics:**
- Not in PRD (internal operational concerns)
- Supports NFRs from PRDs (observability, reliability)
- May be proactive (before issues) or reactive (after incidents)

**Examples:**
- "Set up Prometheus metrics for notification service API latency"
- "Implement blue-green deployment for zero-downtime releases"
- "Add alerting for notification queue depth > 1000"

**Threshold for PRD Creation:** None

**Research Source:** **Implementation Research** (observability §4.3, deployment §5.2, operational best practices)

**Traceability Format:**
```
Story: Set up Prometheus metrics for notification API latency
Justification: Supports NFRs from PRD-XXX (§7 - Observability requirements: p99 latency < 200ms)
Reference: Implementation Research §4.3 - Metrics & Monitoring
Implementation Guidance: Implementation Research §4.3 - Prometheus Code Example
```

---

##### Summary: Backlog Story Categories

| Category | Requires PRD? | Threshold | Research Source | Traceability Format |
|----------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **PRD-Derived** | Parent PRD exists | N/A | Both Research types (via PRD) | Standard parent-child link |
| **Emergent Implementation** | No | Trace to parent PRD | Implementation Research | "Necessary to implement PRD-XXX; ref: Impl Research §X" |
| **Technical Debt** | No | N/A | Implementation Research §6 | "ref: Impl Research §6.X - Anti-pattern Name" |
| **Bug Fixes** | No | N/A | Original PRD/Spec | "Restores PRD-XXX intended behavior" |
| **Minor Enhancements** | Maybe | >5 SP OR >2 weeks OR core workflow | Business + Implementation | "Addresses UX gap; Low complexity" OR "PRD Update Required" |
| **UX/UI Improvements** | Maybe | >5 SP OR >2 weeks OR core workflow | Business + Implementation | "Improves PRD-XXX based on feedback" OR "PRD Update Required" |
| **Operational/DevOps** | No | N/A | Implementation Research §4.3, §5.5 | "Supports NFRs from PRD-XXX; ref: Impl Research §X" |

**Critical Requirement:** Non-PRD-derived stories (Categories 2-7) MUST reference Implementation Research sections using format:
```
Reference: Implementation Research §[section number] - [Pattern/Anti-pattern Name]
```

This ensures:
- Traceability for technical decisions
- Developers have immediate access to patterns and pitfalls
- Consistency across implementation (same patterns from same source)
```

### UPDATE 3: Update Section 4.4 (PRD Creation Timeline)

**Location:** Section 4.4.2 (Planning Phase Sequence)

**Modify Existing Diagram to Include Research Artifacts:**

```markdown
#### 4.4.2 Planning Phase Sequence (Updated with Research Artifacts)

```
1. Strategic Planning

```

---

### UPDATE 4: Add Research Architecture Section (New Section 11)

**Location:** After Section 10 (Conclusion), before "End of Document"

**New Section:**

```markdown
---

## 11. Research Architecture for SDLC Artifacts

**Version:** 1.0 (added in v1.1 guideline update)
**Purpose:** Define research artifact structure supporting SDLC artifact creation

---

### 11.1 Two-Part Research Architecture

**Problem:** Comprehensive research artifacts (1200+ lines) waste context when loaded for every SDLC artifact creation.

**Solution:** Split research into two focused documents aligned with SDLC phases.

---

#### 11.1.1 Business Research

**File Pattern:** `[Product]_business_research.md`
**Template:** `docs/research/research_generator/business_research_template.md`
**Generator:** `docs/research/research_generator/business_research_generator.xml`

**Focus:**
- Market dynamics, competitive positioning
- User needs, pain points, workflows
- WHAT capabilities (user value perspective)
- Strategic direction, business model
- **NO technology prescriptions**

**Informs Artifacts:**
- Product Vision
- Epics
- PRDs (business sections: functional requirements, business NFRs)
- Initiatives
- High-Level User Stories

**Content Structure:**
1. Problem Space Analysis (user pain points, market impact)
2. Market & Competitive Landscape (segments, business models, value propositions)
3. Gap Analysis - Business Lens (market gaps, UX gaps, integration gaps from user perspective)
4. Product Capabilities - Strategic (WHAT to build, WHY users need it - NO code)
5. Strategic Recommendations (positioning, roadmap, go-to-market)
6. Risk Analysis (market, competitive, adoption risks)
7. User Personas (detailed)
8. References (business citations)

**Example Content:**
```markdown
### Gap Analysis (Business Research)

**Gap: Real-Time Dependency Visualization**
- **Description:** Users cannot visualize how delays in one task ripple through project dependencies
- **User Impact:** Product managers manually traverse links, wasting time identifying at-risk features
- **Market Evidence:** 35% of user reviews request better dependency tracking[^citation]
- **Business Opportunity:** Differentiate from competitors lacking visual dependency intelligence
```

---

#### 11.1.2 Implementation Research

**File Pattern:** `[Product]_implementation_research.md`
**Template:** `docs/research/research_generator/implementation_research_template.md`
**Generator:** `docs/research/research_generator/implementation_research_generator.xml`

**Focus:**
- Architecture patterns, technology stack
- HOW to implement (with code examples)
- Technical NFRs (performance, security specs)
- Pitfalls, anti-patterns, operational guidance
- **Abundant code examples (20+)**

**Informs Artifacts:**
- Backlog Stories (with traceability: "ref: Implementation Research §6.1 - Pattern Name")
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Technical Specifications
- Implementation Tasks

**Content Structure:**
1. Technical Context & Problem Scope
2. Technology Landscape Analysis (competitor tech stacks, architecture patterns)
3. Gap Analysis - Technical Lens (performance limitations, architecture gaps)
4. Implementation Capabilities & Patterns (HOW to build, with code)
5. Architecture & Technology Stack (specific recommendations with versions)
6. Implementation Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns (with mitigation code)
7. Build vs Buy (technical perspective)
8. Code Examples & Benchmarks
9. References (technical citations)

**Example Content:**
```markdown
### Gap Analysis (Implementation Research)

**Gap: Graph Query Performance at Scale**
- **Description:** Relational databases exhibit exponential performance degradation for deep relationship traversal (N chained JOINs)[^11]
- **Technical Impact:** Complex dependency queries unusable at 10K+ artifacts (multi-second latency)
- **Why Existing Solutions Fail:** PostgreSQL stores relationships in join tables; N-level traversal requires N JOINs[^11]
- **Solution:** Neo4j with index-free adjacency for constant-time traversal[^42]
- **Implementation:**
  ```cypher
  MATCH (task:Task {id: $taskId})-[:BLOCKS*1..5]->(dep)-[:CHILD_OF*]->(epic:Epic)
  RETURN DISTINCT epic.id, epic.title
  ```
- **Performance:** O(1) per relationship vs O(N²) for relational[^11]
```

---

#### 11.1.3 Research Overlap Handling

**Overlap Sections:** Gap Analysis, Capabilities, Strategic Recommendations

**Strategy:** Split by **lens** (same domain, different perspective)

**Example: Gap Analysis**

| Section | Business Research Version | Implementation Research Version |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Gap Analysis** | Market gaps (unmet user needs), UX gaps (user friction), Integration gaps (from user workflow perspective) | Technical gaps (performance limitations), Architecture gaps (missing patterns), Integration gaps (from API/technical perspective) |

**Example: Same Feature, Different Lenses**

**Business Research:**
```markdown
**Capability: Real-Time Dependency Visualization**
- User Value: Product managers instantly identify at-risk features
- Priority: Should-have (V1 differentiator)
- Success Criteria: 70% of users managing >20 tasks use weekly
```

**Implementation Research:**
```markdown
**Capability: Graph-Based Dependency Traversal**
- Implementation: Cypher queries on Neo4j
- Code Example: [Full query with explanation]
- Performance: O(1) traversal, p99 < 100ms at 10K nodes
- Testing: [Test code with Neo4j Testcontainers]
```

---

### 11.2 Research Artifact Usage by SDLC Phase

| SDLC Artifact | Business Research | Implementation Research | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Product Vision** | ✅ Full | ❌ None | Pure business/strategy |
| **Epics** | ✅ Full | ❌ None | Business capabilities, user value |
| **PRDs** | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | **Bridge artifact**: Business (functional req, market context) + Implementation (technical NFRs) |
| **Initiatives** | ✅ Full | ❌ None | Strategic themes, market opportunities |
| **High-Level User Stories** | ✅ Full | ❌ None | User goals (purely functional, no tech constraints) |
| **Backlog Stories** | ⚠️ Minimal context | ✅ Full | Primary source; may reference Business for context |
| **ADRs** | ❌ None | ✅ Full | Pure technical decisions |
| **Tech Specs** | ❌ None | ✅ Full | Pure technical design |
| **Implementation Tasks** | ❌ None | ✅ Full | Pure code-level work |

**Key Insight:** Clear separation by phase. Business phase loads Business Research; Implementation phase loads Implementation Research; PRD (bridge) loads BOTH.

---

### 11.3 Backlog Story Traceability to Implementation Research

**Requirement:** Non-PRD-derived Backlog Stories (technical debt, operational, emergent implementation) MUST reference Implementation Research sections.

**Format:**
```
Story Title: Implement circuit breaker pattern for external API calls
Justification: Necessary to implement PRD-XXX requirement robustly
Reference: Implementation Research §6.1 - Anti-pattern: Cascade Failures
Implementation Guidance: Implementation Research §4.7 - Circuit Breaker Code Example
```

**Benefits:**
- **Traceability:** Technical decisions traceable to research
- **Developer Efficiency:** Immediate access to patterns and pitfalls
- **Consistency:** Same patterns from same source across implementation
- **Knowledge Preservation:** Avoids reinventing solutions or repeating mistakes

**Section Numbering:** Implementation Research uses numbered sections (§1.1, §4.2, §6.1) to enable precise references.

---

### 11.4 Research Artifact Lifecycle

**Creation Timing:**

```
Strategic Planning Phase:
└─ Business Research conducted
   ├─ Market analysis
   ├─ Competitive intelligence
   ├─ User persona development
   └─ Gap analysis (business/UX)

Product Discovery Phase:
└─ Implementation Research conducted
   ├─ Technology landscape analysis
   ├─ Architecture pattern research
   ├─ Security/observability/testing patterns
   └─ Code example collection

PRD Creation:
└─ Loads BOTH research types
   ├─ Business Research → Functional requirements, business context
   └─ Implementation Research → Technical NFRs, technology constraints
```

**Research Status:**
- Research artifacts are **point-in-time snapshots** (frozen after creation)
- Updated only when major market shifts or technology changes occur
- Bug fixes or UX improvements do NOT trigger research updates
- Backlog Stories reference research "as-is" for consistency

---

### 11.5 Migration from Monolithic Research

**Existing Research:** Some products may have comprehensive (monolithic) research artifacts created before split architecture.

**Migration Guideline:** `docs/research/research_generator/research_restructuring_guidelines.md`

**Migration Process:**
1. Load existing monolithic research
2. Load Business Research template + Implementation Research template
3. Apply transformation rules from restructuring guidelines
4. Extract business content → Business Research
5. Extract technical content → Implementation Research
6. Validate: Business has no tech prescriptions; Implementation has abundant code
7. Save split artifacts

**Transformation Example:**

**Original (Monolithic):**
```markdown
### Gap Analysis
**Gap: Native AI/ML Workflow Support**
Teams building AI products lack tools to track ML experiments. Current solutions use custom fields (losing type safety) or separate systems (MLflow) that fragment context. Technical implementation requires native graph database support for artifact relationships with specialized UI components for visualizing model performance trends.
```

**Business Research (After Split):**
```markdown
### Gap Analysis
**Gap: Native AI/ML Workflow Support**
- Description: Teams building AI products lack tools to track ML experiments and dataset versions within their product backlog
- User Impact: Data scientists use separate tools, fragmenting context
- Business Opportunity: Capture fastest-growing market segment (AI-native companies)
```

**Implementation Research (After Split):**
```markdown
### Gap Analysis
**Gap: Native AI/ML Artifact Support**
- Description: No existing platforms provide first-class artifact types for ML workflows
- Implementation Approach: Extend graph data model with MLExperiment nodes
- Schema Example:
  ```cypher
  CREATE (exp:MLExperiment {
    id: 'EXP-001',
    datasetVersion: 'v2.1',
    modelAccuracy: 0.87,
    biasMetrics: {...}
  })
  ```
```

---

### 11.6 Research Quality Standards

**Business Research Standards:**
- ✅ All claims cited (market stats, competitive features, user pain points)
- ✅ User-centric language (appropriate for product managers/executives)
- ✅ NO technology prescriptions (no "use Neo4j", "implement OAuth 2.0")
- ✅ Capabilities described from user perspective (what/why, not how)
- ✅ Flesch reading ease >60 for executive summaries

**Implementation Research Standards:**
- ✅ All technical claims cited (benchmarks, framework docs, best practices)
- ✅ Abundant code examples (20+ runnable examples)
- ✅ Specific technology versions (Neo4j 5.12+, not just "Neo4j")
- ✅ Performance targets specific (p99 < 200ms, not "fast")
- ✅ All code syntactically correct
