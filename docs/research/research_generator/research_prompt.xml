      <action>Collect and validate human inputs</action>
      <purpose>Establish clear research scope and prevent hallucination</purpose>
      <details>
        Request from human:
        1. **General Product Idea**: What product are we researching? (e.g., "Universal secrets management CLI tool", "AI-powered code review system")
        2. **Problem Overview**: What problems does this solve? What are the pain points?
        3. **Target Users**: Who will use this? (e.g., "Software engineers, DevOps teams, QA engineers")
        4. **Key Capabilities (Draft)**: What features/capabilities should the product have? (high-level list)
        5. **Initial Constraints**: Any technical, business, or timeline constraints to consider?
        6. **Product References**: Which existing products should be analyzed? (minimum 2-3 competitors or similar solutions)

        IMPORTANT: Do NOT proceed until all inputs are provided and validated.
      </details>
      <anti_hallucination>
        Validate inputs with human:
        - Confirm understanding of product scope
        - Clarify any ambiguous requirements
        - Verify product references are correct and accessible
        - Ask clarifying questions about target users and use cases
        - Confirm constraints are understood correctly

      <details>
        Based on validated inputs, create a research plan covering:
        1. **Products to Analyze**:
           - List human-provided product references as starting points
           - Describe discovery strategy for finding additional products (emerging solutions, market leaders, alternative approaches)
           - Target: Minimum 5-7 products total to ensure comprehensive market coverage
        2. **Research Areas**: Market segmentation, feature analysis, technology stack, architecture patterns
        3. **Key Questions**: Specific questions the research will answer
        4. **Deliverables**: What will be included in final research artifact

        IMPORTANT: Communicate to human that research will EXPAND beyond their provided references to discover:
        - Newly emerged solutions (2024-2025) with innovative capabilities
        - Market leaders that may not have been mentioned
        - Open-source alternatives and niche players

        This ensures comprehensive market understanding and identifies all competitive approaches.

        Present plan to human and get confirmation before proceeding.

      <guidance>
        **Phase 4A: Analyze Human-Provided Product References**

        Start with product references provided by human as initial guideline:
        1. **Analyze Core Capabilities**: What does it do? What are its key features?
        2. **Identify Strengths**: What does it do exceptionally well?
        3. **Identify Weaknesses**: What are its limitations, gaps, or pain points?
        4. **Technology Analysis**: What technology stack does it use? (if publicly available)
        5. **Market Positioning**: Who is the target audience? What segment does it serve?
        6. **Pricing/Business Model**: Open-source? SaaS? Self-hosted? Enterprise?

        **Phase 4B: Discover Additional Market Solutions**

        DO NOT limit research to only human-provided references. Expand research to discover:
        - **Emerging Solutions**: Newly released products (past 1-2 years) with innovative capabilities
        - **Alternative Approaches**: Products using different technical or business model approaches
        - **Market Leaders**: Established solutions that may not have been mentioned but dominate market share
        - **Open-Source Alternatives**: Community-driven solutions that compete with commercial products
        - **Niche Players**: Specialized solutions targeting specific use cases or segments

        Discovery methods:
        - Search for "[product domain] solutions 2024/2025"
        - Research "best [product category] tools" comparison articles
        - Look for GitHub repos with high stars in relevant categories
        - Review Y Combinator, Product Hunt, or tech news for recent launches
        - Check technology-specific ecosystems (e.g., CNCF landscape for cloud-native tools)

        Target: Analyze minimum 5-7 products total, including but not limited to human references.

        **Phase 4C: Create Market Segmentation**

        Group all discovered products (human-provided + newly discovered) into market segments by:
        - Architectural approach (e.g., CLI aggregator vs. hosted platform vs. self-hosted vault)
        - Business model (open-source, commercial SaaS, hybrid, enterprise)
        - Target audience (developers, enterprises, specific verticals)
        - Technical philosophy (e.g., zero-trust, serverless-first, AI-native)

        CRITICAL: Cite sources for every product capability claim.
      </guidance>
      <anti_hallucination>
        - Only analyze products that actually exist and are documented
        - Cite official documentation, GitHub repos, public APIs, blog posts, technical papers
        - If a feature is not documented, do not claim the product has it
        - Distinguish between features in documentation vs. features you can verify
        - When discovering new products, verify they are real (check website, GitHub, social proof)
        - Do not invent products or capabilities - every product must be verifiable through citations

      <action>Identify market and technical gaps</action>
      <purpose>Find opportunities for differentiation and innovation</purpose>
      <guidance>
        Based on competitive analysis, identify:
        1. **Market Gaps**: What user needs are not being addressed?
        2. **Technical Gaps**: What technical capabilities are missing or immature?
        3. **Integration Gaps**: What integrations or interoperability is lacking?
        4. **User Experience Gaps**: Where do existing solutions create friction?

        For each gap, explain:
        - Why it matters (user impact, business value)
        - Why existing solutions fail to address it
        - Potential approaches to fill the gap
      </guidance>
      <anti_hallucination>
        Gaps must be based on analysis of actual product limitations found in research, not speculation.
        Cite specific product documentation or reviews that demonstrate the gap.

      Every recommendation must be specific enough to guide decisions. Avoid vague statements like "consider using microservices" - instead,
      explain WHEN microservices make sense, WHY, what the trade-offs are, and provide architectural examples.

      Examples should be concrete: include code snippets, configuration examples, architecture diagrams (in Mermaid or described clearly).

    <references_section_format>
      At the very end of the document, after all content sections, create a section titled "## References" or "## Works Cited".
      Under this heading, list every footnote in numerical order using this exact format:

      [^1]: Author/Organization Name, "Article or Page Title", accessed [Month Day, Year], URL
      [^2]: Author/Organization Name, "Article or Page Title", accessed [Month Day, Year], URL

      Example:
      ## References

      [^2]: HashiCorp, "Vault Dynamic Secrets", accessed October 2025, https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/dynamic

      Critical rules:
      - Every footnote number used in the text must have a corresponding entry in this section
      - Entries must be in numerical order without gaps
      - Each entry must include: source name, article title in quotes, access date, and full URL
      - URLs must be complete and clickable (include https://)
      - If the exact access date is unknown, use the publication date or current date
    </references_section_format>

      Good: "HashiCorp Vault is a powerful, open-source tool for secrets management, encryption as a service, and privileged access
      management.[^1] Its core capabilities include secure secret storage, dynamic secrets generation, and data encryption.[^1]
      Dynamic secrets are a key differentiator - Vault can generate credentials on-demand for systems like AWS and databases,
      which are short-lived and automatically revoked after their lease expires.[^2]"

      Good: "For the backend services, Go (Golang) is highly recommended for its excellent performance, low memory footprint,
      and built-in concurrency primitives.[^1] Go is particularly well-suited for high-throughput microservices and CLI tools.[^2]

      Example of a simple HTTP server in Go:
      ```go
      package main

      import (
          "fmt"
          "net/http"
      )

      func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
          fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
      }

      func main() {
          http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
          http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
      }
      ```

      Trade-offs: While Go offers superior performance, teams already experienced with Python or Node.js may face a learning curve.[^3]"

      Good: "**Integration Gap**: While both Doppler and Infisical offer extensive cloud provider integrations, neither provides
      native integration with HashiCorp Nomad for secret injection.[^1][^2] This creates friction for teams using Nomad as their
      orchestration platform, forcing them to use Vault directly or build custom integration layers. This gap represents an opportunity
      to provide first-class Nomad support, potentially through a Nomad task driver plugin.[^3]"
