The Challenge

  Loading this entire comprehensive research artifact for every SDLC artifact creation is inefficient:
  - Business-oriented SDLC artifacts (Product Vision, Epics, PRDs) need market analysis, user problems, competitive positioning, strategic recommendations
  - Implementation-oriented SDLC artifacts (Backlog Stories, ADRs, Tech Specs, Code) need technical architecture, tech stack, security patterns, implementation pitfalls, code examples

  Questions for Clarification

  1. SDLC Artifact Coverage - What are ALL the artifacts?
  - Business phase: Product Vision, Epic, PRD
  - Implementation phase: Backlog Story, ADR, Tech Spec, User Story
  - Are there others I should account for?

  2. Overlap Areas - Which sections serve BOTH phases?
  - My hypothesis: Gap Analysis (3), Product Capabilities (4), and Strategic Recommendations (7) span both phases
  - Is this correct, or do you see different overlaps?

  3. Split Granularity - How many parts?
  - Option A: 2-part split (Business Research + Implementation Research) with shared sections duplicated
  - Option B: 3-part split (Business Research + Shared/Bridge Research + Implementation Research) with no duplication
  - Which approach do you prefer?

  4. Document Relationship - Should splits reference each other?
  - Should "Implementation Research" explicitly reference sections from "Business Research"?
  - Or should each be fully self-contained for that phase's needs?

  5. Template Adaptation - New templates or modified existing?
  - Create entirely new templates (business_research_template.md, implementation_research_template.md)?
  - Or keep one master template with clear "skip if business-only" / "skip if implementation-only" markers?

  6. Prompt Strategy - Separate prompts or conditional logic?
  - Create business-research-generator.xml + implementation-research-generator.xml?
  - Or single prompt with research_phase parameter (business|implementation|full)?

  Please answer these questions so I can create a precise, actionable plan that matches your vision.

> Explain your hypothesis for #2 Overlap Areas

⏺ My Hypothesis for Overlap Areas (Question #2)

  Let me walk through each section of the Research Artifact Template and explain which phase(s) I believe it serves:

  BUSINESS-ONLY Sections

  Section 1: Problem Space Analysis
  - Current state, pain points, impact if not solved, evolution of problem
  - Why business-only: Product Vision needs this to articulate the "why." Epics need to understand user pain. PRDs frame requirements around problems.
  - Implementation doesn't need: Developers implementing a backlog story don't need market-level problem context—they need technical requirements.

  Section 2: Market & Competitive Landscape
  - Market segmentation, competitive analysis, feature matrix
  - Why business-only: Product Vision positions against competitors. Epics prioritize based on competitive gaps. PRDs define features that differentiate.
  - Implementation doesn't need: Developers don't care that "Jira has 65,000 customers"—they need to know how to implement the specific feature.

  IMPLEMENTATION-ONLY Sections

  Section 5: Architecture & Technology Stack
  - System design, programming languages, databases, deployment, data models
  - Why implementation-only: Backlog Stories need to know "use Neo4j with Cypher queries." ADRs document architecture decisions. Tech Specs detail component design.
  - Business doesn't need: Product Vision/PRD shouldn't prescribe "use Go with Gin framework"—that's premature technical commitment.

  Section 6: Implementation Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
  - Common mistakes, anti-patterns, operational challenges
  - Why implementation-only: Developers need to avoid "treating graph DB like relational DB." These are coding-level concerns.
  - Business doesn't need: Product managers don't need to know about "God Service anti-pattern" when writing Epics.

  OVERLAP Sections (Serve BOTH Phases)

  Section 3: Gap Analysis
  - Market gaps, technical gaps, integration gaps, UX gaps
  - Why BOTH:
    - Business needs market/UX gaps: "No tool supports AI/ML workflows" → becomes Epic "Build ML Experiment Tracking"
    - Implementation needs technical/integration gaps: "Graph databases solve performance issues" → informs Backlog Story "Migrate from PostgreSQL to Neo4j"
  - The bridge: Gap analysis translates business opportunities into technical solutions

  Section 4: Product Capabilities Recommendations
  - Core functional capabilities, security, observability, testing, API design, integrations, AI/Agent support
  - Why BOTH:
    - Business needs high-level capabilities: PRD lists "Support MLExperiment artifact type with accuracy metrics" (what to build)
    - Implementation needs detailed capabilities: Backlog Story details "Implement OAuth 2.0 with RBAC" with code examples (how to build)
  - The bridge: Capabilities have strategic justification (business) AND implementation guidance (technical)

  Section 7: Strategic Recommendations
  - Market positioning, feature prioritization, build vs buy, open source strategy, roadmap phases
  - Why BOTH:
    - Business needs positioning/prioritization: Product Vision states "Graph-native architecture differentiates us." Epics prioritized as "Must-have MVP" vs "V2 enhancement"
    - Implementation needs build/buy decisions: Backlog Story says "Integrate Auth0 (don't build custom OAuth)" based on build-vs-buy analysis
  - The bridge: Strategy informs both WHAT to build (business) and HOW to build it (implementation)

  METADATA/CONTEXT Sections (Probably in BOTH)

  Section 8: Areas for Further Research
  - Could be either: Business might need "validate AI/ML persona assumptions," implementation might need "benchmark Neo4j vs ArangoDB"

  Section 9: Conclusion & Executive Summary
  - Likely both: High-level synthesis helps Product Vision, while technical summaries help implementation planning

  Appendices (Product-specific, References, Examples)
  - Mixed: Business needs strategic references, implementation needs code examples

  ---
  The Key Insight

  The overlap sections (3, 4, 7) are multi-level:
  - They contain both strategic/business framing (top-level) AND tactical/implementation details (deep-dive)
  - Example from Section 4 (Capabilities):
  Business layer:  "Support AI/ML artifacts" → goes in PRD
  Technical layer: "MLExperiment schema with JSON fields" → goes in Backlog Story

  My Proposed Solution

  Based on this analysis, I believe Option B (3-part split) makes most sense:

  1. Business Research (Sections 1, 2, + high-level from 3, 4, 7)
    - For: Product Vision, Epics, PRDs
    - Includes: Problems, market, gaps (business), capabilities (strategic), recommendations (positioning)
  2. Bridge/Shared Research (Full sections 3, 4, 7)
    - For: Cross-phase reference
    - Includes: All gap analysis, all capabilities (strategic + technical), all strategic recommendations
    - Could be loaded when creating PRDs (transitional artifact between phases)
  3. Implementation Research (Sections 5, 6, + technical from 3, 4, 7)
    - For: Backlog Stories, ADRs, Tech Specs, Code
    - Includes: Architecture, tech stack, pitfalls, capabilities (implementation), recommendations (build/buy)

  Does this reasoning align with your understanding of the SDLC phases? Or do you see different boundaries between business and implementation concerns?

> 1. SDLC Artifact Coverage - What are ALL the artifacts?
  - Business phase: Product Vision, Epic, PRD, Initiatives, High-level User Stories (these are implementation-agnostic)
  - Implementation phase: Backlog Story, ADR, Tech Spec, Implementation Tasks

  2. Overlap Areas - Which sections serve BOTH phases?
  - Split these common sections, but with the clear focus on the corresponding phase

  3. Split Granularity - How many parts?
  Option A

  4. Document Relationship - Should splits reference each other?
  Each should be fully contained, but with limited facts and information overlap

  5. Template Adaptation - New templates or modified existing?
  - Entirely new templates (business_research_template.md, implementation_research_template.md)

  6. Prompt Strategy - Separate prompts or conditional logic?
  - Create business-research-generator.xml + implementation-research-generator.xml

  Section Distribution Strategy

  Business Research (For: Product Vision, Epic, PRD, Initiatives, High-level User Stories)

  | Section                           | Content Focus                                                                                          | Why Business Phase Needs This
                                               |
  |-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------
  ---------------------------------------------|
  | 1. Problem Space                  | Pain points, user impact, market evolution                                                             | Product Vision articulates user problems; Epics prioritize by
  pain severity                                   |
  | 2. Market & Competitive           | Market segments, competitor analysis, feature matrix                                                   | PRD positions features against competitors; Epics identify
  differentiation opportunities                      |
  | 3. Gap Analysis                   | Business-focused gaps: Market gaps, UX gaps, high-level integration gaps                               | Epics derived from unmet user needs; Initiatives target market
  opportunities                                  |
  | 4. Capabilities (Strategic)       | What to build: High-level capabilities, business value, user value, priority (Must-have/Should-have)   | PRD defines functional requirements; High-level User Stories
  describe features without implementation details |
  | 5. Strategic Recommendations      | Business-focused: Market positioning, feature prioritization (MVP vs V2), go-to-market, roadmap phases | Product Vision sets market position; Initiatives aligned with
  roadmap phases                                  |
  | 6. Further Research (Business)    | Market validation, persona refinement, competitive intelligence gaps                                   | Identifies business assumptions to validate before implementation
                                               |
  | 7. Executive Summary & Conclusion | Business-focused synthesis                                                                             | Quick reference for stakeholders and product leadership
                                               |

  Key Principle: NO technology prescription. Business research answers "WHAT problem to solve, WHY it matters, WHO needs it, WHEN to build it" — without saying "use Neo4j" or "implement OAuth 2.0."

  Implementation Research (For: Backlog Stories, ADRs, Tech Specs, Implementation Tasks)

  | Section                           | Content Focus                                                                                                       | Why Implementation Phase Needs This
                                  |
  |-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------
  --------------------------------|
  | 1. Technical Context              | High-level problem recap (1-2 paragraphs), focus on technical challenges                                            | Developers need context without full market analysis
                                  |
  | 2. Technology Landscape           | How competitors solve this technically (tech stacks, architectures, not business models)                            | ADRs reference industry patterns; Tech Specs learn
  from proven approaches           |
  | 3. Gap Analysis                   | Technical gaps: Graph DB performance, event-driven architecture, API design patterns                                | Backlog Stories address specific technical
  limitations                              |
  | 4. Capabilities (Technical)       | How to build: Architecture, security patterns, observability, testing strategies, API design, code examples         | Tech Specs detail component design; Backlog Stories
  implement specific capabilities |
  | 5. Architecture & Tech Stack      | System design, languages, frameworks, databases, deployment, data models                                            | ADRs document technology choices; Implementation
  Tasks use recommended stack        |
  | 6. Implementation Pitfalls        | Anti-patterns, common mistakes, operational challenges, migration issues                                            | Developers avoid known pitfalls; Code reviews
  reference these patterns              |
  | 7. Strategic Recommendations      | Technical-focused: Build vs buy decisions, open-source strategy (licensing implications), technology evolution path | Backlog Stories decide "integrate Auth0" vs "build
  custom"; ADRs justify build/buy  |
  | 8. Further Research (Technical)   | Technology benchmarks, framework evaluations, performance testing needs                                             | Identifies technical spikes needed before
  implementation                            |
  | 9. Technical Summary & References | Implementation-focused synthesis, all technical citations                                                           | Quick reference for architects and senior developers
                                  |

  Key Principle: Assumes product direction is set. Implementation research answers "HOW to build it, WHICH technologies, WHAT patterns to use, WHAT mistakes to avoid."

  Content Overlap Strategy

  For sections that appear in BOTH (Gap Analysis, Capabilities, Strategic Recommendations):

  Overlapping Sections - Different Lenses

  Example: Gap Analysis (Section 3)

  Business Research Version:
  ### 3.1 Market Gaps

  **Gap 1: Native AI/ML Workflow Support**
  - **Description:** Product teams building AI-driven products lack tools
    that track ML experiments, dataset versions, and model performance
    within their product backlog.
  - **User Impact:** Data scientists use separate tools (MLflow), creating
    fragmentation and reducing traceability from business requirement to
    deployed model.
  - **Opportunity:** First-class ML artifact support differentiates our
    platform for AI-native companies (fastest-growing market segment).
  - **Business Value:** Capture emerging AI product market; reduce churn
    from tool fragmentation.

  Implementation Research Version:
  ### 3.1 Technical Gaps

  **Gap 1: Graph Query Performance at Scale**
  - **Description:** Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) suffer
    exponential performance degradation when traversing deep relationship
    chains—exactly what's needed for dependency analysis.[^11]
  - **Technical Impact:** Complex dependency queries become unusable at
    10K+ artifacts. Jira users report multi-second JQL query times.[^11]
  - **Why Existing Solutions Fail:** Relational databases store relationships
    in join tables. Traversing N levels deep requires N chained JOINs.[^11]
  - **Solution Approach:** Native graph database (Neo4j) with index-free
    adjacency for constant-time traversal regardless of graph size.[^42]
  - **Implementation:** [Code examples, schema design, query patterns]

  Notice:
  - Same problem domain (product backlog management)
  - Different lenses: Business sees "market opportunity," Implementation sees "technical solution"
  - Minimal factual overlap: Both might mention "current tools are fragmented" but business focuses on user pain, implementation focuses on why PostgreSQL fails
  - Self-contained: Each document provides complete context for its phase

  ---
  File Outputs to Create

  1. business_research_template.md

  - Sections: Problem Space → Market/Competitive → Business Gap Analysis → Strategic Capabilities → Market Positioning & Roadmap
  - Placeholders optimized for business stakeholders
  - NO code examples, NO architecture diagrams, NO technology recommendations
  - Appendix: Business-specific considerations (go-to-market, pricing models, adoption strategies)

  2. implementation_research_template.md

  - Sections: Technical Context → Technology Landscape → Technical Gap Analysis → Implementation Capabilities → Architecture/Stack → Pitfalls → Build/Buy
  - Abundant code examples, configuration snippets, architecture diagrams
  - Minimal market/competitive content (just enough for context)
  - Appendix: Technology-specific considerations (CLI patterns, SaaS architecture, AI/ML infrastructure)

  3. business-research-generator.xml

  - Steps focused on: Market research, competitive intelligence, user persona validation, strategic positioning
  - Anti-hallucination: Verify market claims, competitor features, user pain points
  - Validation checklist: Business criteria (market size validated, positioning clear, roadmap phases justified)
  - Output path: docs/research/[product_name]_business_research.md

  4. implementation-research-generator.xml

  - Steps focused on: Technology stack evaluation, architecture pattern analysis, security/observability best practices, pitfall documentation
  - Anti-hallucination: Verify technology benchmarks, framework capabilities, code examples are syntactically correct
  - Validation checklist: Technical criteria (architecture justified, tech stack current, security patterns cited, code examples runnable)
  - Output path: docs/research/[product_name]_implementation_research.md

  ---
  Execution Approach

  I will create these 4 files in sequence, ensuring:

  1. No overwrites (all new files in docs/research/research-generator/)
  2. Self-contained documents (each phase has complete context)
  3. Focused content (business avoids tech details, implementation avoids market analysis)
  4. Limited overlap (same facts appear only when essential for understanding)
  5. Clear traceability (templates reference which SDLC artifacts they inform)

  ---
  Confirmation Before Proceeding

  Does this plan match your vision? Specifically:

  - ✅ 2-part split (Business + Implementation)
  - ✅ Overlap sections split by lens (same domain, different focus)
  - ✅ Self-contained documents (minimal factual overlap)
  - ✅ New templates (not modified existing)
  - ✅ Separate generators (not conditional logic)
  - ✅ SDLC artifacts clearly mapped (Business: Vision/Epic/PRD/Initiatives/High-level Stories; Implementation: Backlog Story/ADR/Tech Spec/Tasks)

  Should I proceed with creating the 4 files?

> Clarify the following questions and assumptions first: Which document provide non-functional requirements, metrics, success criteria for PRD? Are functional/non-functional requirements, success criteria for
Backlog user stories derived directly from PRDs? Do we treat feature level PRDs as a borderline artifact between business and implementaton phases, acting as factual bridge ?

⏺ Excellent questions! These clarifications are crucial for determining where certain critical content belongs. Let me work through each one:

  ---
  Question 1: Which document provides non-functional requirements, metrics, success criteria for PRD?

  My Current Understanding (needs your validation):

  Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) for PRD:
  - Source: Should come from Implementation Research
  - Why: NFRs are technical constraints (performance, scalability, security, availability)
  - Example NFRs:
    - "API response time p99 < 200ms"
    - "Support 10,000 concurrent users"
    - "99.9% uptime SLA"
    - "Data encrypted at rest (AES-256)"

  But wait—PRD is a Business Phase artifact, so how does it get Implementation Research?

  🤔 This reveals a tension in the model.

  Three Possible Approaches:

  Option A: PRD is purely business-focused
  - PRD contains only functional requirements ("what" to build)
  - NFRs live entirely in Backlog Stories/Tech Specs (implementation phase)
  - Problem: Product managers need to communicate performance/security expectations before implementation starts

  Option B: PRD is a hybrid artifact
  - PRD sits at the boundary between phases
  - Gets input from BOTH Business Research (market gaps, features) AND Implementation Research (NFRs, technical constraints)
  - This seems most realistic

  Option C: Business Research includes "business-level NFRs"
  - Business Research has high-level success criteria ("must handle enterprise scale")
  - Implementation Research translates to specific metrics ("10K concurrent users, p99 < 200ms")
  - PRD uses business-level criteria, Tech Specs use implementation-level metrics

  Which approach matches your SDLC workflow?

  ---
  Question 2: Are functional/non-functional requirements for Backlog Stories derived directly from PRDs?

  My Assumption (confirm or correct):

  YES, with refinement:

  PRD (Feature-level)
  ├─ Functional Requirement: "Users can authenticate via OAuth 2.0"
  ├─ NFR: "Support 1000 logins/hour, 99.9% availability"
  │
  └─> Backlog Story (Implementation-level)
      ├─ Functional: "Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow"
      ├─ NFR: "Token validation < 50ms, support Auth0/Okta providers"
      ├─ Acceptance Criteria: "Given valid token, API returns 200..."
      └─ Technical Details: "Use Authlib library, Redis for token cache"

  Flow:
  1. PRD defines WHAT (high-level requirement)
  2. Backlog Story defines HOW (specific implementation approach)
  3. NFRs cascade and refine: PRD's "1000 logins/hour" becomes Story's "token validation < 50ms"

  Is this the correct relationship? Or do Backlog Stories sometimes introduce entirely new requirements not mentioned in PRD?

  ---
  Question 3: Do we treat PRD as borderline artifact acting as factual bridge?

  This is the CRITICAL question!

  If PRD is a bridge artifact, then the split strategy changes significantly:

  Revised Split Model (if PRD is a bridge):

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                    BUSINESS PHASE                            │
  │  Artifacts: Product Vision, Epics, Initiatives               │
  │  Research: Business Research ONLY                            │
  │  Focus: Market, users, problems, strategic positioning       │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                │
                                ▼
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                    BRIDGE PHASE (PRD)                        │

  │  Research: BOTH Business + Implementation Research           │
  │  Focus: Translate business needs into technical requirements │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                │
                                ▼
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                 IMPLEMENTATION PHASE                         │
  │  Artifacts: Backlog Stories, ADRs, Tech Specs, Tasks         │
  │  Research: Implementation Research ONLY                      │
  │  Focus: Architecture, code, patterns, execution              │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  If PRD is a bridge, then:

  Business Research should include:
  - High-level capabilities (what features solve market gaps)
  - Success metrics (business KPIs: user adoption, revenue impact)
  - Strategic NFRs (enterprise-scale, compliance requirements, security posture)
    - Example: "Must support SAML SSO for enterprise customers"
    - Example: "SOC 2 compliance required for target market"

  Implementation Research should include:
  - Technical capabilities (how to implement features)
  - Performance metrics (p99 latency, throughput, scalability targets)
  - Technical NFRs (specific performance/security/reliability specs)
    - Example: "SAML SSO via Auth0 integration, token validation < 50ms"
    - Example: "SOC 2: Implement audit logging API, 1-year retention"

  PRD pulls from BOTH:
  - Functional requirements from Business Research (market gaps → features)
  - Strategic NFRs from Business Research (compliance, security posture)
  - Technical NFRs from Implementation Research (performance targets)
  - Technology recommendations from Implementation Research (when applicable)

  ---
  My Questions Back to You:

  Q1: Is PRD a bridge artifact?

  - If YES: PRD creation loads BOTH research documents (business + implementation)
  - If NO: PRD is purely business phase, only loads business research

  Q2: Who writes NFRs in PRD?

  - Product Manager alone (using business research)?
  - Product Manager + Tech Lead collaboration (using both research docs)?
  - Derived automatically from business research's success criteria?

  Q3: What's the relationship between PRD and Backlog Story requirements?

  - Strict derivation: Every Backlog Story requirement traces to a PRD requirement
  - Refinement: Backlog Stories elaborate on PRD requirements with implementation details
  - Discovery: Backlog Stories can introduce new requirements discovered during technical planning

  Q4: Do High-level User Stories have NFRs?

  - You listed "High-level User Stories" in Business phase (implementation-agnostic)
  - Do these include technical constraints, or just user goals?
  - Example: "As a user, I can authenticate via SSO" (no tech details) vs "...via SAML with Auth0" (tech-specific)

  ---
  Proposed Refinement Based on "PRD as Bridge"

  If PRD is indeed a bridge artifact, I suggest:

  Business Research Template includes:

  ## 4. Product Capabilities Recommendations

  ### 4.1 Core Functional Capabilities
  [What features to build - market-driven]

  ### 4.2 Business-Level Success Criteria
  - User adoption metrics
  - Business value metrics
  - Competitive positioning goals

  ### 4.3 Strategic Non-Functional Requirements
  - Compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA)
  - Enterprise capabilities (SSO, RBAC, audit trails)
  - Scalability posture (SMB vs Enterprise scale)
  - Security posture (industry standards, certifications)

  Implementation Research Template includes:

  ## 4. Technical Capabilities & Requirements

  ### 4.1 Implementation Patterns
  [How to build features - with code examples]

  ### 4.2 Performance & Reliability Metrics
  - API latency targets (p50, p95, p99)
  - Throughput requirements (requests/sec, concurrent users)
  - Availability SLAs (uptime %)
  - Error rate thresholds

  ### 4.3 Technical Non-Functional Requirements
  - Specific security implementations (encryption algorithms, auth protocols)
  - Observability requirements (logging, metrics, tracing)
  - Testing requirements (coverage %, test types)
  - Deployment requirements (CI/CD, infrastructure)

  PRD Creation Process:

  Step 1: Load Business Research
    → Extract: Market gaps, functional capabilities, strategic NFRs

  Step 2: Load Implementation Research
    → Extract: Technical NFRs, performance targets, technology constraints

  Step 3: Synthesize into PRD
    → Functional Requirements (from business)
    → Non-Functional Requirements (from both business strategic + implementation technical)
    → Success Criteria (from both business metrics + technical metrics)

  Please Clarify:

  1. Is PRD a bridge artifact that uses BOTH research documents?
  2. Who defines NFRs in PRD, and from which research source?
  3. Are Backlog Story requirements strictly derived from PRD, or can they introduce new requirements?
  4. Do High-level User Stories contain any technical constraints, or are they purely functional?

  Once you clarify these, I can finalize the exact content distribution between Business Research and Implementation Research templates.

**Human Response**
My questions section:
Q1. Which document provides non-functional requirements, metrics, success criteria for PRD?
Answer: Option B
Q2. Are functional/non-functional requirements for Backlog Stories derived directly from PRDs?
Answer: Yes, but needs your research and clarification on the following:
    - Do Backlog Stories sometimes introduce entirely new requirements not mentioned in PRD
        Example: minor product enhancements, bug reports, UX/UI improvements
    - We need to identify these special cases for backlog stories and how to treat them.

Q3. Do we treat PRD as borderline artifact acting as factual bridge?
YES, Proposed Refinement Based on "PRD as Bridge" accepted

Your questions section:
1. Is PRD a bridge artifact that uses BOTH research documents?
YES
2. Who defines NFRs in PRD, and from which research source?
Answer: Both sources should give input for PRD. Final review comes from Product Manager and Tech Leads.
3. Pending research and clarification from Q2 before final decision
4. Do High-level User Stories contain any technical constraints, or are they purely functional?
Answer: Purely functional

  Research & Clarification: Q2 - Backlog Stories That Don't Derive from PRDs

  Categories of "Non-PRD-Derived" Backlog Stories

  Based on common SDLC practices, here are the special cases:

  Category 1: Emergent Implementation Requirements

  Description: Technical requirements discovered during implementation that weren't visible during PRD creation.

  Examples:
  - "Add database index on user_id column for query performance" (discovered during load testing)
  - "Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for external API calls" (discovered during integration)
  - "Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures" (architectural necessity not in PRD)

  Characteristics:
  - ✅ Directly supports a PRD feature/requirement
  - ✅ Necessary for proper implementation
  - ❌ Not explicitly stated in PRD (PRD said "integrate with Auth0," didn't specify retry logic)

  Research Source: Implementation Research (architecture patterns, best practices, pitfalls)

  ---
  Category 2: Technical Debt & Refactoring

  Description: Improvements to existing code/architecture that don't add user-visible features.

  Examples:
  - "Refactor authentication service to use dependency injection"
  - "Migrate from REST polling to WebSocket for real-time updates"
  - "Extract shared validation logic into reusable library"

  Characteristics:
  - ❌ Not in any PRD (doesn't add features)
  - ✅ Improves code quality, performance, or maintainability
  - ✅ May enable future PRD features (e.g., WebSocket refactor enables real-time collaboration PRD)

  Research Source: Implementation Research (anti-patterns, pitfalls, architecture evolution)

  ---
  Category 3: Bug Fixes

  Description: Correcting defects in existing functionality.

  Examples:
  - "Fix: OAuth token refresh fails after 1 hour"
  - "Fix: Graph query returns duplicate nodes when filtering by status"

  Characteristics:
  - ❌ Not in PRD (bugs discovered post-deployment)
  - ✅ Restores intended behavior from original PRD requirement
  - ⚠️ May reveal missing NFRs from original PRD ("token refresh wasn't considered")

  Research Source: Minimal (primarily references original PRD/Tech Spec for intended behavior)

  ---
  Category 4: Minor Product Enhancements (No PRD)

  Description: Small user-facing improvements that don't warrant full PRD process.

  Examples:
  - "Add keyboard shortcut Cmd+K for command palette"
  - "Display timestamp in user's local timezone instead of UTC"
  - "Add 'Copy to clipboard' button for API keys"

  Characteristics:
  - ✅ User-facing (unlike technical debt)
  - ⚠️ Small enough that creating full PRD is overhead
  - ⚠️ May accumulate into "death by a thousand cuts" without strategic oversight

  Research Source:
  - Business Research (UX gaps, competitive analysis for inspiration)
  - Implementation Research (UI patterns, best practices for similar features)

  ---
  Category 5: UX/UI Improvements

  Description: Design iterations based on user feedback or usability testing.

  Examples:
  - "Improve graph visualization: add zoom controls and node filtering"
  - "Redesign onboarding flow to reduce steps from 5 to 3"
  - "Add loading skeleton screens for better perceived performance"

  Characteristics:
  - ✅ Improves existing features (already has PRD)
  - ⚠️ May be significant enough to warrant PRD update/addendum
  - ✅ Often data-driven (analytics, user feedback)

  Research Source:
  - Business Research (UX gaps, competitive UX patterns)
  - Implementation Research (UI component libraries, performance optimization)

  ---
  Category 6: Operational/DevOps Stories

  Description: Infrastructure, monitoring, deployment improvements.

  Examples:
  - "Set up Prometheus metrics for API latency monitoring"
  - "Implement blue-green deployment for zero-downtime releases"
  - "Add alerting for Neo4j connection pool exhaustion"

  Characteristics:
  - ❌ Not in PRD (internal operational concerns)
  - ✅ Supports NFRs from PRDs (observability, reliability)
  - ✅ May be proactive (before issues occur) or reactive (after incidents)

  Research Source: Implementation Research (observability, deployment, operational best practices)

  Recommended Treatment Strategy

  | Category                | Requires PRD?            | Research Source   | Backlog Story Justification                     |
  |-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
  | Emergent Implementation | No (trace to parent PRD) | Implementation    | "Necessary to implement PRD-XXX requirement"    |
  | Technical Debt          | No                       | Implementation    | "Improves code quality; enables future PRD-YYY" |
  | Bug Fixes               | No                       | Original PRD/Spec | "Restores intended behavior from PRD-XXX"       |
  | Minor Enhancements      | Maybe (threshold-based)* | Both (light)      | "Addresses UX gap; low complexity"              |
  | UX/UI Improvements      | Maybe (threshold-based)* | Both              | "Improves PRD-XXX based on user feedback"       |
  | Operational             | No                       | Implementation    | "Supports NFRs from PRD-XXX (observability)"    |

  Threshold for requiring PRD:
  - Complexity: > 5 story points or > 2 weeks effort
  - User impact: Changes core workflow or adds new user-facing capability
  - Strategic: Affects product positioning or roadmap priorities

  How This Affects Research Split

  Business Research should include:

  ## 3.4 User Experience Gaps
  [Identifies UX friction in existing solutions]
  → Informs: Minor UX enhancement stories, UI improvement stories

  ## 4.1 Core Functional Capabilities
  [Defines what features to build]
  → Informs: PRD functional requirements, high-level user stories

  ## 7.2 Feature Prioritization (Table Stakes vs Differentiators)
  [Helps decide: Does this enhancement need PRD or just a story?]
  → Informs: Threshold for creating PRDs vs direct backlog stories

  Implementation Research should include:

  ## 3.2 Technical Gaps
  [Identifies missing technical capabilities in existing solutions]
  → Informs: Emergent implementation requirement stories

  ## 6.1 Common Implementation Pitfalls
  [Documents mistakes to avoid]
  → Informs: Technical debt stories, refactoring priorities

  ## 6.3 Operational Challenges
  [Deployment, monitoring, scaling challenges]
  → Informs: Operational/DevOps stories

  ## 5.3 Observability Capabilities
  [Logging, monitoring, alerting patterns]
  → Informs: Observability implementation stories

  My Recommendation for Q2/Q3 Final Decision:

  3. Backlog Stories: Requirements Derivation Model

  Primary Flow (PRD-Derived):
  PRD → Backlog Stories (strict derivation)
  ├─ Functional requirements decomposed into implementation tasks
  ├─ NFRs refined into specific technical stories
  └─ Emergent implementation details added (with PRD traceability)

  Secondary Flow (Non-PRD-Derived):
  Business Research → Minor Enhancements (no PRD required)
  Implementation Research → Technical Debt, Operational, Bug Fix stories
  User Feedback/Analytics → UX Improvement stories (may update PRD)

  Key Principle:
  - All user-facing features (new capabilities) require PRD
  - Implementation details, tech debt, operations, minor UX can be direct backlog stories
  - Traceability: Even non-PRD stories should reference research sections or original PRD/Epic

  ---
  Questions for Final Confirmation:

  A. Threshold for PRD vs Direct Story: Do you agree with the complexity/impact thresholds above, or do you have different criteria?

  B. Traceability for Non-PRD Stories: Should backlog stories for technical debt/operations explicitly reference Implementation Research sections?
  - Example: "Story: Implement circuit breaker pattern (ref: Implementation Research §6.1 - Anti-pattern: Cascade Failures)"

  C. Research Document Updates: When bug fixes or UX improvements reveal gaps in original research, should we:
  - Update research documents (living documents)?
  - Create addendum/errata documents?
  - Leave research frozen (point-in-time snapshot)?

  D. Minor Enhancements - Research Requirement: For Category 4 (minor enhancements), should teams:
  - Do lightweight research (competitive analysis, UX patterns) before creating story?
  - Reference existing research only?
  - Skip research entirely (rely on team expertise)?

  Once you answer A-D, I'll have complete clarity to create the split templates and generators.

**Human Response**

 A. Threshold for PRD vs Direct Story: Do you agree with the complexity/impact thresholds above, or do you have different criteria?
 Answer: Fully agree

B. Traceability for Non-PRD Stories: Should backlog stories for technical debt/operations explicitly reference Implementation Research sections?
- Example: "Story: Implement circuit breaker pattern (ref: Implementation Research §6.1 - Anti-pattern: Cascade Failures)"
Answer: YES

C. Research Document Updates: When bug fixes or UX improvements reveal gaps in original research, should we:
- Leave research frozen (point-in-time snapshot)

D. Minor Enhancements - Research Requirement: For Category 4 (minor enhancements), should teams:
- Do lightweight research (competitive analysis, UX patterns) before creating story

IMPORTANT:
- Additional output required: guideline document providing AI context and instructions to use newly created business and implementation prompts and templates to restructure existing monolith research artifacts
- Additional tasks to be performed after restructuring of research prompt, template:
    - Create additional plan to update `docs/sdlc_artifacts_comprehensive_guideline.md` with the findings from this session
    - Ask clarifing questions and proceed with the update only after confirmation
