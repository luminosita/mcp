  - GitHub[^26]
  - Marketplace[^27]
  - Select annotation to see diff of particular commit
  - Trace back history through annotations

---

### Hybrid Approach

Combine tools for complete workflow:

**Step 1: Visual Review**
- Use **XinDiff** or **Meld** for initial visual diff review
- Add in-place comments or annotations

**Step 2: Structured Feedback**
- Use **vscode-code-review** to create structured feedback documents
- Export as HTML, Markdown, or CSV

**Step 3: Team Distribution**
- Use **git-appraise** for distributing reviews (no server needed)
- Or commit to **Review Board** / **Gerrit** if server available
