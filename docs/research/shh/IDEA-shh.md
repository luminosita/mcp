- Problem overview
    - Our development team keeps secrets (API keys, passwords, client_id/secret) within plain text .env files
    - We need a CLI tool to fetch secrets from secret repositories and provide the way to pass secrets to system process in a highly secured way
    - There should be no secret leaks by putting secrets in plain-text files, tracing secrets within shell history, listing running system processes for parameters
- Target users (high-level)
    - Software engineers
    - QA engineers
    - DevOps
- Key capabilities (draft)
    - Multiple secret repositories
    - Logging with redacted information (no secrets should show up in a log file)
    - Configuration for source and path for secrets
    - Mapping of retrieved secrets to custom export variable names (e.g., environment variables)
    - CLI tool for shell execution
    - Discovery of secret repository access info (local environment variables, local token stores)
    - Production-ready tested tool
- Initial constraints
    - Inital scope is to encapsulate all AI agent artifacts within MCP Server
