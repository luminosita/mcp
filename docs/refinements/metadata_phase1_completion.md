## Architectural Decision: Upstream-Only Traceability

### Decision
**Artifact templates will contain ONLY upstream traceability (parent links and research references). Downstream tracking (child artifact lists, status, progress) is deferred to backlog management software (JIRA, Linear, etc.).**

### Rationale

**Problems with Downstream Tracking in Artifacts:**
1. **High Maintenance Burden:** Every child artifact creation requires parent file update
2. **Stale Data:** Tables become outdated immediately after creation
3. **Git Noise:** Constant status updates create merge conflicts and noisy commit history
4. **Duplicates Backlog Software:** JIRA/Linear already provide bidirectional links, epic progress, burndown charts
5. **Wrong Tool:** Markdown files are for design decisions and requirements, not live project tracking
6. **Scope Creep:** Artifacts become project management dashboards instead of design documents

**Benefits of Upstream-Only Approach:**
1. ✅ **Low Maintenance:** Set once when artifact is created, rarely changes
2. ✅ **Stable Content:** Parent links and research references don't change
3. ✅ **Clear Responsibility:** Design decisions in artifacts, tracking in backlog software
4. ✅ **Better Tool Fit:** Each tool does what it's designed for
5. ✅ **Cleaner Git History:** Only meaningful content changes, not tracking updates
6. ✅ **Easier Adoption:** Less burden on teams to maintain artifacts

### What We Keep (Upstream Traceability)

**Parent Links (Hierarchical):**
```yaml
Parent Product Vision: VIS-XXX
Parent Initiative: INIT-XXX
Parent Epic: EPIC-XXX
Parent PRD: PRD-XXX
Parent High-Level Story: HLS-XXX
```

**Research Links (Context):**
```yaml
Informed By Business Research: [Link]
Informed By Implementation Research: [Link]
Informed By Spike: SPIKE-XXX
```

**Research Reference Sections:**
- Business Research References (which sections applied, how)
- Implementation Research References (patterns, examples, anti-patterns)

### What We Defer to Backlog Software

**Status Tracking:**
- Story status (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Epic completion percentage
- Sprint assignment
- Story point estimates

**Relationships:**
- Epic → Stories (parent-child links)
- PRD → Stories (requirement coverage)
- Initiative → Epics (portfolio hierarchy)

**Progress Tracking:**
- Burndown charts
- Velocity tracking
- Sprint progress
- Release tracking

**Team Management:**
- Story assignment
- Sprint planning
- Capacity planning
- Team metrics

### Implementation in Backlog Software

**JIRA Example:**
```
Epic: EPIC-042 User Authentication
├─ Parent Link: Initiative INIT-005
├─ Custom Field: Parent Product Vision = VIS-001
├─ Custom Field: Business Research = [link]
└─ Child Stories (managed by JIRA):
    ├─ US-123: OAuth Integration (In Progress)
    ├─ US-124: 2FA Setup (To Do)
    └─ US-125: Password Reset (Done)
```

**Key Point:** JIRA maintains bidirectional parent-child links natively. Artifacts only need to store upstream parent references.

### Documentation Strategy

**Artifacts (Markdown Files):**
- **Purpose:** Design decisions, requirements, context, rationale
- **Content:** What, why, how (design level)
- **Update Frequency:** Rarely (only when design changes)
- **Traceability:** Upstream only (parents and research)

**Backlog Software (JIRA/Linear):**
- **Purpose:** Work tracking, status, progress, team coordination
- **Content:** Who, when, status, progress
- **Update Frequency:** Constantly (daily or more)
- **Traceability:** Bidirectional (parent ↔ child)

### Migration Path for Existing Artifacts

If existing artifacts have downstream tracking sections:
1. Extract downstream tracking data into backlog software
2. Configure backlog tool with proper parent-child links
3. Remove downstream tracking sections from artifacts
4. Update artifact version and add change note

    ║ [Parent HLS or Parent PRD]
    ▼
Backlog Story (US-XXX)

```

**All links flow upstream (child → parent).** Backlog software provides downstream views (parent → children).

## Traceability Impact

### Before Phase 1
- ❌ No parent links in Product Vision, Initiative, PRD
- ❌ No research integration
- ❌ Weak connection between business strategy and implementation
- **Upstream Traceability: ~30%**
- **Downstream Traceability: 0%** (not in files or backlog)

### After Phase 1
- ✅ Complete parent-child hierarchy in artifacts
- ✅ Research documents explicitly linked at all levels
- ✅ Clear upstream traceability from implementation → strategy
- ✅ Downstream tracking delegated to appropriate tool (backlog software)
- **Upstream Traceability: ~95%** (+65 points!)
- **Downstream Traceability: Managed by backlog software**

### What This Enables

**Impact Analysis (Bottom-Up):**
```bash
# Question: "This backlog story is blocked. What business goal does it impact?"
US-234 → PRD-012 → EPIC-042 → VIS-001
         └─ FR-05  └─ "Secure authentication"  └─ "Trust & Security" capability

# Answer: Impacts Vision Capability "Trust & Security", Epic "User Authentication"
```

**Context Retrieval (Bottom-Up):**
```bash
# Question: "Why are we building this feature this way?"
US-234 (Backlog Story)
  └─ Implementation Research §4.2: "OAuth2 recommended for third-party auth"
  └─ Parent PRD: PRD-012 (NFRs: <200ms auth, 99.9% uptime)
      └─ Parent Epic: EPIC-042 (Business Value: Reduce support tickets 40%)
          └─ Business Research §3.1: "78% of users abandon apps with complex signup"
```

**Requirement Coverage (Via Backlog Software):**
```sql
-- JIRA Query: Show all stories implementing PRD-012
SELECT story_id, status, assignee, sprint
FROM stories
WHERE parent_prd = 'PRD-012'
ORDER BY fr_covered, status;
```

## Benefits Realized

### 1. **Low Maintenance Burden**
- Parent links set once at creation, rarely change
- No need to update artifacts when child statuses change
- Clean git history with only meaningful design changes

### 2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **Artifacts:** Design rationale, requirements, context (what & why)
- **Backlog Software:** Work tracking, status, progress (who & when)

### 3. **Better Tool Utilization**
- Markdown for documentation and version control
- JIRA/Linear for project management and reporting
- Each tool optimized for its purpose

### 4. **Improved Adoption**
- Teams not burdened with updating artifact files constantly
- Focus on design decisions, not status updates
- Easier to maintain over time

### 5. **Strong Traceability**
- Upstream: Every artifact knows its parents and research context
- Downstream: Backlog software provides real-time child artifact tracking
- Bidirectional: Backlog software links maintain both directions

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Complete)
- ✅ Phase 1 templates updated with upstream traceability
- ✅ Downstream tracking sections removed
- ✅ Architectural decision documented

### Phase 2 (Next - Technical Artifacts)
Continue with ADR, Tech Spec, and Implementation Task templates:
- Add `Informed By Spike` fields
- Add `Informed By Implementation Research` fields
- Strengthen Implementation Research reference sections
- **No downstream tracking sections**

### Phase 3 (Backlog Software Configuration)
Configure backlog software for bidirectional tracking:
1. Add custom fields for upstream links:
   - Parent Product Vision (VIS-XXX)
   - Parent Initiative (INIT-XXX)
   - Parent Epic (EPIC-XXX)
   - Parent PRD (PRD-XXX)
   - Business Research Link
   - Implementation Research Link

2. Configure native parent-child links:
   - Epic → Stories
   - PRD → Stories (via custom field)
   - Initiative → Epics

3. Create dashboards:
   - Epic progress (child story completion)
   - PRD FR coverage (stories by FR)
   - Initiative portfolio view

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ Update metadata refinement plan to reflect architectural decision
- ✅ Update quick reference guide
- Update SDLC guideline with backlog software integration guidance

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Upstream traceability** in artifacts provides clear context without maintenance burden
2. **Research integration** captures "why" decisions were made
3. **Parent links** enable bottom-up impact analysis

### What We Changed
1. **Removed downstream tracking** to avoid duplication and maintenance burden
2. **Delegated status tracking** to appropriate tool (backlog software)
3. **Focused artifacts** on design decisions, not project management

### Key Insight
**"Use the right tool for the job"** - Artifacts for design rationale, backlog software for tracking. Don't try to make artifacts do double duty as project dashboards.

## Recommendations for Adoption

### For Teams Starting Fresh
1. Configure backlog software with custom fields for upstream links
2. Use artifact templates for new features
3. Link backlog stories to artifacts via custom fields
4. Use backlog software reports for downstream tracking

### For Teams with Existing Artifacts
1. Audit existing artifacts for downstream tracking sections
2. Migrate tracking data to backlog software
3. Remove downstream tracking sections from artifacts
4. Update artifacts to Phase 1 metadata standards
5. Configure backlog software with proper parent-child links

### For Integration
**When Creating New Artifact:**
1. Fill upstream metadata (Parent, Informed By fields)
2. Create corresponding item in backlog software
3. Link backlog item to artifact (custom field with file path or wiki link)
4. Let backlog software handle status and progress tracking

**When Querying for Context:**
1. Start from backlog story (where work is tracked)
2. Follow upstream links to PRD, Epic, Vision
3. Follow research links for design rationale
4. Use backlog software for downstream impact (other stories on same epic/PRD)

---

## Conclusion

Phase 1 is complete with a refined approach that:
- ✅ Establishes strong **upstream traceability** in artifacts
- ✅ Delegates **downstream tracking** to backlog software
- ✅ Reduces **maintenance burden** on teams
- ✅ Enables **clear separation of concerns** between design and tracking
- ✅ Provides foundation for Phases 2-4 metadata refinement

**Key Principle:** *Artifacts capture "what" and "why", backlog software tracks "who", "when", and "status".*
