**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Evaluator:** Claude Code
**Task:** TASK-018
**Scope:** Evaluate `/prompts/CLAUDE/CLAUDE-*.md` files for clarity, duplicates, gaps, and PRD-000 alignment

---

## Executive Summary

The specialized CLAUDE.md files provide **comprehensive, well-organized implementation guidance** for Python development. The files demonstrate:

✅ **Strengths:**
- Clear separation of concerns across 6 specialized files
- Progressive complexity (basics → advanced patterns)
- Excellent code examples and practical guidance
- Strong cross-referencing between files
- Consistent terminology and structure

⚠️ **Critical Gap Identified:**
- **CLAUDE-tooling.md missing 4 new tools** added in PRD-000 v2:
  - Renovate (dependency automation)
  - NuShell (cross-platform scripting)
  - Devbox (isolated environments)
  - Podman (container runtime)

📝 **Recommended Actions:**
1. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Update CLAUDE-tooling.md with new PRD-000 v2 tooling
2. **MEDIUM:** Minor clarifications in CLAUDE-core.md (navigation improvements)
3. **LOW:** Consider adding Devbox-specific examples in CLAUDE-architecture.md

**🚨 CRITICAL GAP - Missing PRD-000 v2 Tooling:**

The following tools from PRD-000 v2 are **NOT documented**:

1. **Renovate** (FR-16, FR-21, Decision D4)
   - Purpose: Automated dependency updates, security vulnerability detection
   - Missing: Installation, configuration (renovate.json), usage, CI/CD integration

2. **NuShell** (FR-19)
   - Purpose: Cross-platform shell scripting (macOS, Linux, BSD, Windows)
   - Missing: Installation, basic syntax, script examples, replacing Bash scripts

3. **Devbox** (FR-20, Decision D3)

## Cross-File Analysis: Duplicated Content

### Intentional Duplicates (GOOD - No Action Needed)

| Content | Files | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Basic type hints** | CLAUDE-core.md (brief), CLAUDE-typing.md (comprehensive) | Core shows basics, typing provides depth |
| **pytest commands** | CLAUDE-tooling.md (tool commands), CLAUDE-testing.md (testing workflow) | Different contexts: tool setup vs testing strategy |
| **Pydantic models** | CLAUDE-typing.md (type perspective), CLAUDE-validation.md (validation perspective) | Different focus areas, acceptable overlap |
| **Project structure** | CLAUDE-core.md (brief overview), CLAUDE-architecture.md (detailed) | Orchestration file vs specialized file |
| **Pre-commit** | CLAUDE-core.md (checklist), CLAUDE-tooling.md (configuration) | Different aspects: what to check vs how to configure |

### Problematic Duplicates (NONE IDENTIFIED)

No problematic duplications detected. All overlaps serve different purposes or provide progressive detail.

   ```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours to add comprehensive sections for all 4 tools

---

### Priority 2: MEDIUM - Update CLAUDE-architecture.md

**Action:** Add Devbox and Podman deployment context

**Sections to Add:**

1. **Development Environment with Devbox** (add to Project Structure Philosophy section)
   - How src layout works within Devbox shell
   - devbox.json configuration for project dependencies

2. **Container Deployment Structure** (add to end)

2. **CLAUDE-testing.md:** Add Podman container integration testing examples
3. **CLAUDE-validation.md:** Add MCP tool input validation patterns
4. **All files:** Add references to PRD-000 v2 decisions where relevant

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours total

---

## Conclusion

The specialized CLAUDE.md files provide **excellent foundational guidance** for Python development. However, they require **urgent updates** to align with PRD-000 v2 tooling requirements.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Strong foundation: Clear, well-organized, comprehensive
- ✅ Minimal problematic duplication
- ❌ **Critical gap:** 4 new tools from PRD-000 v2 not documented (Renovate, NuShell, Devbox, Podman)
- ❌ Coverage: Only 52% of PRD-000 v2 requirements fully covered

**Immediate Next Step:**
Update CLAUDE-tooling.md with sections for Renovate, NuShell, Devbox, and Podman (Priority 1, ~2-3 hours)
