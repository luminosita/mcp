## Phase 2 Enhancement Tasks

### GRAD-001: JIRA Integration Strategy
**Priority**: Medium
**Phase Requirement**: Phase 2
**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours
**Status**: ⏳ Pending

**Context**:
Automate export of backlog user stories and implementation tasks to JIRA for team collaboration and tracking.

**Background**:
Currently, backlog stories and implementation tasks exist only in markdown files within `/artifacts/backlog_stories/` subfolders. Development teams typically use JIRA or similar tools for sprint planning and task assignment. Manual copy-paste is error-prone and time-consuming.

**Requirements**:
1. **JIRA Field Mapping**:
   - Backlog Story → JIRA Epic/Story mapping
   - Implementation Tasks → JIRA Sub-tasks mapping
   - Preserve traceability (PRD reference, high-level story ID)
   - Map acceptance criteria, priorities, estimates

2. **Automation Approach**:
   - Research: JIRA REST API capabilities
   - Design: API-based export vs. manual template
   - Decide: Real-time sync vs. one-time export
   - Consider: Bidirectional sync (JIRA updates → markdown updates?)

3. **JIRA Issue Template**:
   - Create custom JIRA issue type matching backlog story structure
   - Include fields: Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Technical Requirements, Acceptance Criteria
   - Link to upstream PRD and high-level story

4. **Prototype Export Script**:
   - Language: Python (JIRA API library available)
   - Input: `/artifacts/backlog_stories/US-XX-XX/backlog_story_v3.md`
   - Output: JIRA issue created with all metadata
   - Handle: Attachments (link to tech specs, ADRs in JIRA)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] JIRA field mapping document created
- [ ] Export strategy decided and documented
- [ ] JIRA issue template configured
- [ ] Prototype script exports 1 backlog story successfully
- [ ] Documentation added to strategy doc Section 6 (Execution Playbook)

**Files to Create/Update**:
- `/docs/jira_integration_strategy.md`
- `/scripts/export_to_jira.py` (or similar)
- `/docs/context_engineering_strategy_v1.md` (add Section 6.X)

### GRAD-002: Shared Tech Spec Repository
**Priority**: Medium
**Phase Requirement**: Phase 2
**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours
**Status**: ⏳ Pending

**Context**:
Enable reuse of technical specifications across multiple backlog stories to reduce duplication and ensure consistency.

**Background**:
Common technical patterns emerge across backlog stories (e.g., authentication endpoints, database schemas, error handling strategies). Currently, each backlog story generates independent tech spec. This leads to:
- Duplication of identical specifications
- Inconsistency when similar patterns evolve differently
- Wasted effort regenerating known solutions

**Requirements**:
1. **Tech Spec Reuse Patterns**:
   - Define when/how tech specs can be reused
   - Identify reusable spec types: API patterns, data models, common services
   - Document versioning strategy for shared specs

2. **Discovery Mechanism**:
   - Create tech spec catalog/index
   - Implement search by: domain (auth, storage, etc.), technology (REST, GraphQL), pattern (CRUD, pagination)
   - Store in: `/artifacts/shared_tech_specs/` directory

3. **Versioning for Shared Specs**:
   - Semantic versioning (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
   - Breaking change policy
   - Deprecation process

4. **Integration with Tech Spec Generator**:
   - Before generating new spec, check shared catalog
   - Prompt: "Found similar spec: [link]. Reuse, customize, or create new?"
   - If reuse: Reference shared spec in backlog story
   - If customize: Fork shared spec, modify, save as local variant

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Reuse patterns documented
- [ ] Shared spec catalog structure defined
- [ ] Versioning strategy documented
- [ ] Tech spec generator updated to check catalog
- [ ] At least 3 example shared specs created (e.g., REST API auth, database connection, error handling)

**Files to Create/Update**:
- `/docs/tech_spec_reuse_patterns.md`
- `/artifacts/shared_tech_specs/` (directory)
- `/artifacts/shared_tech_specs/catalog.md` (index)
- `/prompts/tech_spec_generator.xml` (update with catalog check)

### GRAD-003: Automated Execution Script
**Priority**: High
**Phase Requirement**: Phase 2
**Estimated Effort**: 10-15 hours
**Status**: ⏳ Pending

**Context**:
Reduce manual task lookup from TODO.md by creating script that automates generator execution sequence with human approval checkpoints.

**Background**:
Phase 1 requires human to manually:
1. Open `/TODO.md`
2. Find next pending task
3. Check dependencies
4. Run `/kickoff execute-generator TASK-XXX`
5. Repeat

This is tedious and error-prone. Phase 2 should automate task orchestration while preserving human approval at critical gates.

**Requirements**:
1. **TODO.md Parser**:
   - Parse task structure: ID, dependencies, status, validation criteria
   - Build dependency graph
   - Identify next executable task (dependencies satisfied)

2. **Automated Context Assembly**:
   - Read task metadata to determine required files
   - Load: CLAUDE.md, specialized CLAUDE.md, generator, templates, input artifacts
   - Verify all files exist before execution

3. **Generator Execution Orchestration**:
   - Execute generator with assembled context
   - Capture outputs (terminal artifact + next generator)
   - Save to specified paths
   - Update task status in TODO.md

4. **Human Approval Checkpoints**:
   - After each iteration (v1, v2, v3)
   - Before proceeding to next SDLC phase
   - At approval gates defined in strategy Section 6

5. **Script Interface**:
   ```bash
   # Execute next task
   ./scripts/execute_next_task.sh

   # Execute specific task
   ./scripts/execute_task.sh TASK-003

   # Execute until checkpoint
   ./scripts/execute_until_checkpoint.sh TASK-007
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Script successfully parses TODO.md
- [ ] Dependency graph correctly identifies next task
- [ ] Context assembly automated and verified
- [ ] Generator execution automated
- [ ] Human approval prompts at correct checkpoints
- [ ] Task status updates in TODO.md automatically
- [ ] Error handling for missing files, invalid dependencies
- [ ] Logging of all executions for audit trail

**Files to Create**:
- `/scripts/execute_next_task.sh` (or .py)
- `/scripts/execute_task.sh` (or .py)
- `/scripts/parse_todo.py` (helper)
- `/scripts/assemble_context.py` (helper)
- `/docs/automated_execution_guide.md`

**Integration**:
- Update `/docs/context_engineering_strategy_v1.md` Section 6.2 with script usage
- Update `/CLAUDE.md` Commands Reference section

### GRAD-004: Self-Critique Loops (Chain-of-Verification)
**Priority**: High
**Phase Requirement**: Phase 2
**Estimated Effort**: 12-16 hours
**Status**: ⏳ Pending

**Context**:
Implement automated Chain-of-Verification (research Section 2.4) for artifact critique, reducing human workload in iteration cycles.

**Background**:
Phase 1 requires human to:
1. Review artifact v1
2. Write structured critique in `/feedback/{artifact}_v1_critique.md`
3. Run refine
4. Repeat for v2, v3

Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) automates steps 1-2, allowing human to focus on approval/rejection rather than detailed critique writing.

**Requirements**:
1. **Artifact Critique Agent**:
   - Create `/prompts/artifact_critique_agent.xml`
   - Input: Generated artifact (e.g., product_vision_v1.md) + validation checklist
   - Process:
     - **Step 1**: Generate initial assessment
     - **Step 2**: Generate verification questions for each quality dimension (completeness, clarity, actionability, traceability)
     - **Step 3**: Answer verification questions independently
     - **Step 4**: Generate final critique based on verification results
   - Output: Structured critique file matching human format

2. **Integration with Refine-Generator**:
   - Update `/.claude/commands/refine.md`
   - New workflow:
     - After artifact v1 generated → automatically invoke critique agent
     - Generate `/feedback/{artifact}_v1_critique.md`
     - Display critique summary to human
     - Human approves/rejects/modifies critique
     - Proceed with refinement if approved

3. **Quality Threshold Logic**:
   - Define threshold: 80% validation checklist pass rate
   - If v1 passes 80%+ criteria → prompt human: "High quality detected. Skip v2 iteration?"
   - If v1 passes 100% criteria → auto-approve (with human notification)
   - If v1 passes <80% → mandatory iteration to v2

4. **Critique Quality Validation**:
   - Test critique agent on existing artifacts (if available)
   - Compare AI critique vs. human critique for consistency
   - Measure: Precision (AI identifies real issues), Recall (AI misses human-found issues)
   - Iterate on critique agent prompt until quality acceptable

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Critique agent prompt created and validated
- [ ] Agent successfully critiques test artifacts
- [ ] Critique output matches human format
- [ ] Refine-generator command updated
- [ ] Threshold logic implemented (80% pass rate)
- [ ] Human approval workflow integrated
- [ ] At least 3 artifacts critiqued automatically with human validation
- [ ] Documented in strategy Section 6.3

**Files to Create/Update**:
- `/prompts/artifact_critique_agent.xml`
- `/.claude/commands/refine.md` (update workflow)
- `/docs/context_engineering_strategy_v1.md` (Section 6.3 update)

## Phase 3 Vision (Future)

**Note**: Phase 3 details will be defined after Phase 2 completion and graduation. Preliminary vision:

- **Agentic Workflow**: AI reads TODO.md → spawns contexts → executes → validates → iterates autonomously
- **Multi-Agent Critique**: Separate generator and reviewer agents for unbiased assessment
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: ML-based quality prediction learns from historical artifact data
- **Live Documentation**: Strategy document auto-updates with learnings in real-time
- **Full Cascade Automation**: Vision → Code generation without human intervention (except final approval)

**Prerequisites**:
- Claude Code API enhancements (context spawning, persistent state)
- Robust error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Comprehensive test suite for all generators
- Production-grade monitoring and alerting
