## **4. Architectural Blueprint & Technology Recommendations**
*The high-level technical strategy for building a scalable, secure, and maintainable product. This structure is synthesized from the Backlog and MCP Server reports.*

### **4.1. High-Level System Architecture**
[Include a system architecture diagram. Describe the major components/services and their interactions (e.g., API Gateway, Artifact Management Service, Automation Engine).]

### **4.2. Recommended Technology Stack**
[A table outlining the recommended technology for each architectural component, with a clear justification for each choice.]

| Component               | Recommended Technology | Justification                                                                 |
