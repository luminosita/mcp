# Kickoff Chat

## Step 1

Gap Analysis Report: Context Engineering Proof-of-Concept

  1. Analysis Summary

  I've parsed the advanced prompt engineering research document and extracted Context Engineering topics relevant to the proof-of-concept. The document provides comprehensive coverage of:

  - Foundational patterns: Structured prompts with 5 core components (persona, task, context, exemplars, format)
  - Advanced techniques: Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thoughts, Self-Refine, Chain-of-Verification
  - Documentation templates: PRD, ADR, Technical Specs, User Stories
  - Code generation: Security-first patterns, frontend/backend/IaC/testing templates
  - Validation frameworks: RAGAS metrics (adapted for non-RAG), quality checklists

  2. SDLC Phase Mapping

  Vision/Planning → PRD generation, gap analysis, clarification patterns
  Design → Architecture Decision Records, Technical Specifications, API specs
  Implementation → Code generation (frontend/backend/IaC), security templates
  Testing → Unit test generation, code review automation, TDD workflows

  3. Critical Gaps Identified

  Gap 1: Scope Definition for "Proof-of-Concept" Deliverables

  Impact: CriticalIssue: The kickoff command requests a PoC but doesn't specify:
  - Should we generate artifacts for a real example project (e.g., "build a todo app") or abstract templates?
  - How many iterations are required to demonstrate "iterative learning" (goal G2)?
  - What constitutes "measurable improvement" in iteration quality?

  Gap 2: Validation Criteria Operationalization

  Impact: HighIssue: Success criteria reference:
  - "Flesch score >60" — requires automated readability scoring tool (not in scope)
  - "Traceability" — needs defined format (e.g., markdown reference links? structured metadata?)
  - "Actionability" — subjective without clear rubric

  Gap 3: CLAUDE.md Orchestration Strategy Ambiguity

  Impact: MediumIssue: The research document mentions CLAUDE.md for persistent context but doesn't detail:
  - Routing logic: How does root CLAUDE.md "tell the agent" which specialized file to use? (Are we relying on file path conventions, explicit instructions, or something else?)
  - Context limits: What's the threshold for splitting contexts into specialized files vs. keeping in root?

  4. Proposed Assumptions (Pending Confirmation)

  Assumption A1: We'll build a concrete example project to generate real artifactsRationale: Abstract templates are already in the research doc; demonstrating end-to-end generation proves concept better.

  Assumption A2: 3 iterations = Initial generation → Self-critique → RefinementRationale: Aligns with Self-Refine pattern from research (Section 2.4).

  Assumption A3: Validation uses manual checklist (not automated scoring)Rationale: Automated Flesch scoring is out of scope; checklists are practical for PoC.

  Assumption A4: CLAUDE.md routing uses explicit directory referencesRationale: Root file contains: "For PRD generation, consult /docs/templates/prd/CLAUDE.md"

  5. Clarification Questions (Prioritized)

  Question 1 (Critical): What project should the PoC generate artifacts for?

  Options:
  - A) Simple web app (e.g., task manager with frontend + backend)
  - B) CLI tool (e.g., file processor)
  - C) Abstract "Feature X" using placeholder requirements
  - D) Other (please specify)

  Impact: Determines scope of all generated artifacts (PRDs, specs, code).

  Question 2 (High): How should we measure "iterative improvement" for Goal G2?

  Options:
  - A) Manual comparison checklist (iteration 1 vs. 2 vs. 3)
  - B) Specific metrics (e.g., # of missing sections, # of security issues found)
  - C) Narrative summary showing learnings applied
  - D) Other (please specify)

  Impact: Defines success criteria for primary goal.

  Question 3 (Medium): Should specialized CLAUDE.md files be created proactively or on-demand?

  Options:
  - A) Proactive: Create all specialized files upfront (e.g., /docs/templates/prd/CLAUDE.md, /code/backend/CLAUDE.md)
  - B) On-demand: Create only when a task requires >500 tokens of specialized context
  - C) Hybrid: Pre-create for major SDLC phases, on-demand for edge cases

  Impact: Affects folder structure and initial setup time.

  6. Next Steps

  ⚠️ Paused at ANALYZE phase — awaiting your responses to clarification questions before proceeding to CONFIRM/GENERATE phases.

  **Human Response**:
  - All proposed assumptions are correct
  - We are creating CLI tool. Product details should be created as part of Product Vision generation task. 
  - My understanding of the research document is that we generally need a sophisticated prompt for each phase/step/task of the process. Maybe that is an overkill. Iterative proof of concept project should clarify that assumption. 
  - One of the tasks should be creation of Product Vision Generator prompt followed by that prompt execution. As a result we will get Product Vision template in the form of a sophisticated reusable prompt stored in the folder structure.
  - Another assumption of mine is that each task must be executed in a standalone context. 
  - The only activity performed within this current context should be project initial plan generation as a very first step of Context Engineering framework.
  - Yet another assumption of mine is that the basis of Context Engineering framework is the tree of sophisticated prompts generating sub-prompts for the future phases/steps/tasks and that each template artifact is essentially a prompt generating sub-artifacts.
  - **CRITICAL** Iterative execution of subsequent tasks within standalone contexts
  - We should update our priorities and first establish the clear understanding of the general product creation strategy based on the main research document. That is my understanding of Goal G2, the workflow is prompts generating PAP (product artifacts prompt -> product artifacts + sub-artifacts generator prompt)
  - **CRITICAL** Analyze my response, and perform clarification loop by asking questions until clear strategy/workflow is established
  - Success criteria for G2 would be clear Context Engineering strategy/workflow document
  - Specialized CLAUDE.md files should be created right before execution of the specialized task requiring information from those CLAUDE.md files
  - Each task context should contain main CLAUDE.md file, specialized CLAUDE.md file (by instruction provided in the main CLAUDE.md) at the minimum. 
  - Outcome of this step can also affect the initial context for this session and result in the update of the prompt

  ## Step 2

  ⏺ Clarification Loop: Context Engineering Strategy

  Analysis of Your Response

  I've identified several key insights that shift the project paradigm:

  Core Paradigm Shift

  From: Generate artifacts using pre-written promptsTo: Generate prompts that generate prompts (recursive meta-prompt architecture)

  Critical Insights Extracted

  1. Standalone Context Execution: Each task runs in fresh Claude Code session
  2. Prompt-as-Artifact: Templates ARE sophisticated prompts, not just markdown documents
  3. Recursive Generation: Product Vision Generator Prompt → executes → produces Product Vision Template Prompt
  4. This Session's Scope: Only produce initial project plan, then exit
  5. Success = Strategy Document: Not working software, but validated workflow methodology

  Clarification Questions (Round 1)

  Q1: Recursive Prompt Depth - How Deep?

  Based on your "tree of sophisticated prompts" concept, I need to understand the generation chain:

  Example Chain A (3 levels):
  Meta-Prompt Generator (this session)
    ↓ generates
  Product Vision Generator Prompt
    ↓ generates (in standalone context)
  Product Vision Document

  Example Chain B (4 levels):
  Meta-Prompt Generator (this session)
    ↓ generates
  Product Vision Generator Prompt
    ↓ generates (in standalone context)
  Product Vision Template + Epic Generator Prompt
    ↓ generates (in another standalone context)
  Epic 1 Document + User Story Generator Prompts

  Question: Which depth model aligns with your vision?
  - A) Fixed 3-level: Meta → Generator → Artifact
  - B) Variable depth: Stop when artifact is "terminal" (e.g., source code file)
  - C) SDLC-aligned: One level per phase (Vision → Epic → Story → Spec → Code → Test)
  - D) Other (please specify)

  ---
  Q2: Prompt Storage & Retrieval Strategy

  You mentioned:
  "Each task context should contain main CLAUDE.md file, specialized CLAUDE.md file"

  Scenario: Executing "Product Vision Generator Prompt" in standalone context

  Question: What files should exist when that new session starts?

  Option A (Minimal):
  /CLAUDE.md (root orchestration)
  /prompts/product-vision-generator.xml (the prompt to execute)

  Option B (With Research):
  /CLAUDE.md (root)
  /prompts/product-vision-generator.xml
  /docs/advanced_prompt_engineering_software_docs_code_final.md (research doc)
  /prompts/CLAUDE.md (specialized instructions for prompt execution)

  Option C (Cumulative):
  /CLAUDE.md (root)
  /prompts/product-vision-generator.xml
  /docs/advanced_prompt_engineering_software_docs_code_final.md
  /context/previous_outputs/ (all artifacts from prior tasks)

  Which option, or describe alternative?

  ---
  Q3: Task Execution Trigger Mechanism

  You stated:
  "Another assumption of mine is that each task must be executed in a standalone context"

  Question: How does task execution get triggered?

  Option A (Manual):
  1. This session generates /TODO.md with task list
  2. Human user manually starts new Claude Code session
  3. User provides /prompts/task-N-generator.xml as input
  4. Repeat for each task

  Option B (Semi-Automated):
  1. This session generates /TODO.md + execution script
  2. Script contains instructions like: "Open new session, paste prompt X, save output to Y"
  3. Human executes script steps manually

  Option C (Fully Automated - if possible):
  1. This session generates orchestration prompt
  2. Orchestration prompt contains: "After generating artifact X, spawn new context for task Y using prompt Z"
  3. Single execution chain (may violate Claude Code limitations?)

  Which approach, or describe alternative?

  ---
  Q4: Context Engineering Strategy Document Structure

  You defined Goal G2 success as:
  "Clear Context Engineering strategy/workflow document"

  Question: What sections should this strategy document contain?

  Proposed Structure (please modify/approve):

  # Context Engineering Strategy v1.0

  Approve structure, or specify required changes?

  ---
  Q5: Iteration Strategy for Proof-of-Concept

  You mentioned:
  "Iterative proof of concept project should clarify that assumption"

  Question: How many generation cycles should the PoC demonstrate?

  Scenario Example:
  Iteration 1: Generate Product Vision Generator Prompt → Execute → Get Vision v1
  Iteration 2: Critique Vision v1 → Refine Generator Prompt → Execute → Get Vision v2
  Iteration 3: Apply learnings → Update Strategy Doc → Re-generate → Get Vision v3

  Options:
  - A) 1 iteration per task (demonstrate breadth across SDLC)
  - B) 3 iterations on single task (demonstrate depth of refinement)
  - C) 2 iterations: Initial + one refinement cycle per task
  - D) Other (please specify)

  ---
  Next Steps After Clarification

  Once you answer Q1-Q5, I will:

  1. Synthesize answers into "Context Engineering Strategy Document" (Goal G2 deliverable)
  2. Generate:
    - /TODO.md (task sequence with dependencies)
    - /CLAUDE.md (root orchestration instructions)
    - /docs/context_engineering_strategy.md (the core methodology)
    - /prompts/product-vision-generator.xml (first meta-prompt as example)
  3. Present for approval before exiting this context
  4. Provide instructions for launching first standalone task context

  Status: Paused at CLARIFY phase, awaiting Q1-Q5 responses.

**Human Response**
Q1: I created Mermaid diagram for clarification

```mermaid
graph TD;
A["Master Prompt (this session)"] -->|GENERATES| P[Master Plan];
A -->|GENERATES| PVP[Product Vision Generator Prompt];

PVP -->|GENERATES| PVD["Product Vision Document (in separate context C1)"] 
PVP -->|GENERATES| EP["Epic Generator Prompt (in separate context C1)"]

EP -->|GENERATES| ED["Epic Document (in separate context C2)"] 
EP -->|GENERATES| PRP["PRD Generator Prompt (in separate context C2)"]

PRP -->|GENERATES| PRD["PRD (in separate context C3)"] 
PRP -->|GENERATES| USP["User Story Generator Prompt (in separate context C3)"]
```
**Notes**: 
- Product Vision Document is the final document not a template. It is based on the template defined in the main research document. If template is missing it should be separately generated and placed in the folder structure so that it can be referenced by PVP (Product Vision Generator Prompt). 
- Epic Document is the final document not a template. It is based on the template defined in the main research document. If template is missing it should be separately generated and placed in the folder structure so that it can be referenced by EP (Epic Generator Prompt). 
- PRD is the final document not a template. It is based on the template defined in the main research document. That template should be extracted from the document, finalized and placed in the folder structure so that it can be referenced by PRP (PRD Generator Prompt). 

Depth model should be SDLC-aligned: One level per phase (Vision → Epic → PRD → Story → (ADR + Spec + Implementation Task) → Code → Test)

---

Q2: Prompt Storage & Retrieval Strategy
New Option:
  /CLAUDE.md (root)
  /prompts/product-vision-generator.xml
  /prompts/CLAUDE-product-vision.md (specialized instructions for prompt execution)
  /prompts/templates/product-vision-template.xml (product vision template, generated or extracted from the main research document)
  /docs/product-idea.md (first draft of product idea, outlining input required by product vision generator prompt)
  /.claude/commands/execute-product-vision-generator.xml or /.claude/commands/execute-generator.xml (fixed execution prompt)

**Notes**:
- fixed execution prompt executes specific generator prompt, provided as an $ARGUMENT. 
- fixed execution prompt can be generic, capable of executing any generator prompt or tied to a specific type of generator prompt
- we might come up with additional documents during the process required by particular prompt
  
---

Q3: Task Execution Trigger Mechanism (excellent question)
This should be one of the main goal of this proof of concept project. The idea is in progression from Option A, to Option B, to Option C how our Context Engineering workflow matures. By the end of this project we should graduate trigger mechanism to Option C (with certain human check points involving validation of the results from the previous executions, we will define some threshold for automated execution)

---

Q4: Context Engineering Strategy Document Structure
Proposed document structure is good for the start. It will slightly evolve as we progress. 

---

Q5: Iteration Strategy for Proof-of-Concept

Option #3 → 3 iterations on single task (demonstrate depth of refinement) as covered in your Scenario Example

Scenario Example:
  Iteration 1: Generate Product Vision Generator Prompt → Execute → Get Vision v1
  Iteration 2: Critique Vision v1 → Refine Generator Prompt → Execute → Get Vision v2
  Iteration 3: Apply learnings → Update Strategy Doc → Re-generate → Get Vision v3

**Notes**:
- This approach should be applied for each SDLC phase until we perform final refinement of all our prompts and templates
- Update Strategy Doc iteration task is critical to keep the whole process on the right path

---

**CRITICAL** Analyze my response, and perform clarification loop by potentially asking questions until clear strategy/workflow is established
  

## Step 3

⏺ Clarification Loop Round 2: Deep Dive Analysis

  Analysis of Your Responses

  I've synthesized your answers and identified the emerging architecture. Several critical insights require validation:

  ---
  Key Architectural Patterns Identified

  Pattern 1: Dual Output Generators

  Every generator prompt produces:
  1. Terminal Artifact (e.g., Product Vision Document v1)
  2. Next-Level Generator Prompt (e.g., Epic Generator Prompt)

  This creates a self-propagating chain.

  Pattern 2: Template Hierarchy

  Research Document (immutable source)
    ↓ extract/generate
  Template Library (/prompts/templates/*.xml)
    ↓ referenced by
  Generator Prompts (/prompts/*_generator.xml)
    ↓ produces
  Final Documents (/artifacts/*)

  Pattern 3: Fixed Execution Harness

  /.claude/commands/execute-generator.xml acts as universal runtime that:
  - Loads specified generator prompt
  - Loads required templates
  - Loads specialized CLAUDE.md context
  - Executes generation
  - Saves outputs

  ---
  Critical Questions - Round 2

  Q6: Generator Prompt Output Format

  When product-vision-generator.xml executes, it must output two distinct artifacts:

  Scenario A (Single-file output):
  <output>
    <product_vision_document>
      # Product Vision: CLI File Processor
      [... full vision document ...]
    </product_vision_document>

    <epic-generator_prompt>
      <system_role>You are Epic decomposition specialist...</system_role>
      [... full next-level generator prompt ...]
    </epic-generator_prompt>
  </output>

  Scenario B (Separate file instructions):
  Generator outputs:
  1. /artifacts/product_vision_v1.md
  2. /prompts/epic-generator.xml

  Then prints: "Next step: Execute /kickoff execute-generator epic-generator"

  Question 6a: Which output pattern should generators use?

  Question 6b: Should the generator prompt itself specify output file paths, or should execute-generator.xml handle file routing based on naming conventions?

  ---
  Q7: Template Extraction Strategy

  You noted:
  "That template should be extracted from the document, finalized and placed in the folder structure"

  The research document contains templates in markdown format (Section 6.1 PRD, 6.2 ADR, etc.).

  Question 7a: Should templates be:
  - Option A: Copied verbatim from research doc as .md files
  - Option B: Converted to XML prompt format with <template> tags
  - Option C: Hybrid - Keep markdown template + wrap in XML with usage instructions

  Example Option B:
  <!-- /prompts/templates/prd-template.xml -->
  <template name="PRD" version="1.0">
    <instructions>
      Fill all sections marked [placeholder].
      Ensure SMART success metrics.
    </instructions>

    <structure>
      # [Product/Feature Name]

      ## Document Metadata
      - Author: [name]
      - Date: [date]
      ...
    </structure>
  </template>

  Question 7b: Who extracts templates?
  - Option A: Master Prompt (this session) extracts all templates upfront
  - Option B: Each generator prompt extracts its own template on first run
  - Option C: Manual extraction by human, stored in repo

  ---
  Q8: Iteration Refinement Mechanics

  Your iteration scenario:
  Iteration 1: Generate PVP → Execute → Get Vision v1
  Iteration 2: Critique Vision v1 → Refine PVP → Execute → Get Vision v2
  Iteration 3: Apply learnings → Update Strategy → Re-generate → Get Vision v3

  Critical ambiguity: What triggers Iteration 2?

  Scenario A (Human-triggered):
  1. Human reviews Vision v1
  2. Human writes critique notes in /feedback/vision_v1_critique.md
  3. Human runs: /kickoff refine-generator product-vision-generator
  4. System reads critique, updates PVP, re-executes

  Scenario B (Self-critique automated):
  1. execute-generator finishes Vision v1
  2. Automatically invokes critique-agent prompt
  3. Critique-agent generates /feedback/vision_v1_critique.md
  4. Automatically updates PVP based on critique
  5. Re-executes (up to 3 times or until quality threshold met)

  Question 8a: Which iteration trigger model for PoC?

  Question 8b: What constitutes "sufficient quality" to stop iterating?
  - Human approval checkbox?
  - Automated checklist pass rate (e.g., 8/10 criteria met)?
  - Fixed 3 iterations regardless of quality?

  ---
  Q9: Context Isolation Boundary

  You specified:
  "Each task must be executed in a standalone context"

  But the Mermaid diagram shows:
  C1: PVP generates both PVD + EP
  C2: EP generates both ED + PRP

  Question 9a: Does "task" = "generator execution" or "document generation"?

  Interpretation A (Generator = Task):
  - Context C1 executes product-vision-generator.xml
  - C1 outputs: Vision Doc + Epic Generator Prompt
  - C1 terminates
  - New Context C2 executes epic-generator.xml

  Interpretation B (Document = Task):
  - Context C1a executes product-vision-generator.xml → outputs Vision Doc only
  - Context C1b executes same generator with different instructions → outputs Epic Generator Prompt only
  - Context C2 executes Epic Generator...

  Question 9b: Should Epic Generator Prompt (produced in C1) have access to Product Vision Document (also produced in C1)?
  - If yes: How does C2 retrieve PVD? (File system read? Passed as argument?)
  - If no: How does Epic Generator know what vision to decompose?

  ---
  Q10: Master Plan Scope

  The Master Prompt (this session) must generate a Master Plan.

  Question 10a: Should the Master Plan be:

  Option A (Task List):
  # Master Plan v1.0

  ## Phase 1: Template Extraction
  - [ ] Extract PRD template from research doc → /prompts/templates/prd-template.xml
  - [ ] Extract ADR template → /prompts/templates/adr-template.xml
  [... etc ...]

  ## Phase 2: Generator Creation
  - [ ] Create product-vision-generator.xml
  - [ ] Create epic-generator.xml
  [... etc ...]

  ## Phase 3: Execution & Iteration
  - [ ] Execute PVP → Vision v1
  - [ ] Critique → Vision v2
  [... etc ...]

  Option B (Executable Workflow):
  # Master Plan v1.0

  ## Execution Sequence
  1. RUN: /kickoff execute-generator product-vision-generator
  2. WAIT_FOR_HUMAN_APPROVAL: Review /artifacts/product_vision_v1.md
  3. IF_APPROVED: RUN /kickoff execute-generator epic-generator
  4. ELSE: RUN /kickoff refine-generator product-vision-generator
  [... state machine logic ...]

  Option C (Dependency Graph):
  graph TD
    T1[Extract Templates] --> T2[Create PVP]
    T2 --> T3[Execute PVP]
    T3 --> T4{Quality Check}
    T4 -->|Pass| T5[Create EP]
    T4 -->|Fail| T6[Refine PVP]
    T6 --> T3

  Which format (or combination)?

  Question 10b: Should the Master Plan include validation criteria for each task?

  Example:
  ## Task: Execute Product Vision Generator
  **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] Vision document contains all 8 required sections
  - [ ] Problem statement includes quantified pain points
  - [ ] Success metrics are SMART-compliant
  - [ ] Epic generator prompt is syntactically valid XML

  ---
  Q11: Specialized CLAUDE.md Lifecycle

  You stated:
  "Specialized CLAUDE.md files should be created right before execution of the specialized task"

  Question 11a: Who creates specialized CLAUDE.md files?

  Scenario A (Master Prompt creates all):
  This session generates:
  - /prompts/CLAUDE-product-vision.md
  - /prompts/CLAUDE-epic.md
  - /prompts/CLAUDE-prd.md
  [... etc for all SDLC phases ...]

  Scenario B (Lazy generation):
  This session generates ONLY:
  - /CLAUDE.md (contains template for specialized CLAUDE.md)

  When execute-generator runs for first time:
  1. Checks if /prompts/CLAUDE-{task}.md exists
  2. If not, generates it from template
  3. Then proceeds with execution

  Question 11b: What information goes in specialized CLAUDE.md vs. root CLAUDE.md?

  Proposed split:
  # /CLAUDE.md (root)
  - Project overview
  - Folder structure explanation
  - How to execute generators
  - Quality standards (Flesch score, etc.)

  # /prompts/CLAUDE-product-vision.md (specialized)
  - Product Vision specific guidelines
  - Reference to vision template location
  - Example product visions from research
  - Common pitfalls for vision generation

  Approve this split, or define different boundaries?

  ---
  Dependency Mapping

  Before finalizing strategy, I need to understand execution dependencies:

  Blocker Analysis:
  Product Vision Generator Prompt depends on:
    ✓ Product Vision Template (must exist first)
    ✓ /docs/product-idea.md (initial input)
    ✓ /prompts/CLAUDE-product-vision.md (specialized context)
    ? Research document access (needed during generation?)

  Epic Generator Prompt depends on:
    ✓ Epic Template
    ✓ Product Vision Document (output from previous step)
    ✓ /prompts/CLAUDE-epic.md
    ? Product Vision Generator Prompt itself (to understand parent context?)

  Question 12: Should each generator have read access to:
  - A) Only its immediate inputs (template + prior artifact)
  - B) All upstream artifacts (Vision → Epic → PRD chain visibility)
  - C) Entire project context (all files in workspace)

  ---
  Meta-Question: Confidence Check

  Question 13: On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that:
  - My understanding of the recursive prompt architecture is correct? [Your rating: __]
  - The questions above address the critical ambiguities? [Your rating: __]
  - We're ready to generate the Strategy Document after this round? [Your rating: __]

  If any rating < 8, please explain what's still unclear.

  ---
  Proposed Next Steps (Pending Your Answers)

  Once you respond to Q6-Q13:

  1. Synthesize into Context Engineering Strategy Document v1.0
  2. Generate initial deliverables:
    - /TODO.md (master task list with dependencies from Q10)
    - /CLAUDE.md (root orchestration from Q11)
    - /docs/context_engineering_strategy.md (comprehensive workflow)
    - /.claude/commands/execute-generator.xml (universal executor from Q3)
    - /prompts/templates/ (extracted templates from Q7)
    - /prompts/product-vision-generator.xml (first generator as exemplar)
    - /docs/product-idea.md (stub for CLI tool idea)
  3. Present complete artifact set for approval
  4. Exit this context with handoff instructions for C1 execution

  Status: Paused at CLARIFY Round 2, awaiting Q6-Q13 responses.

**Human Response**:
Q6: Generator Prompt Output Format

Question 6a: Pattern B, two separate files

Question 6b: Execute-generator.xml handle file routing based on naming conventions. It should consider versioning based on refinement revisions. As we progress deeper in our recursive generator prompt execution we need to establish folder structure to avoid output file duplication. For clarification, output of product vision generator prompt is a single product vision document. Output of epic generator prompt is a set of epic documents and that requires a folder structure for sub-artifacts

---
Q7: Template Extraction Strategy

Question 7a: Option B → Converted to XML prompt format with <template> tags
Question 7b: Who extracts templates?
  Option A: Master Prompt (this session) extracts or generates, in case it is missing in the main document, all templates upfront and stores them in the repo

--- 
Q8: Iteration Refinement Mechanics

Question 8a: Which iteration trigger model for PoC?
This should be one of the main goals of this proof of concept project. The idea is in progression from Option A, to Option B how our Context Engineering workflow matures. By the end of this project we should graduate trigger mechanism to Option B (with certain human check points involving validation of the results from the previous executions, we will define some threshold for automated execution)

Question 8b: What constitutes "sufficient quality" to stop iterating?
- Human approval checkbox is the first phase

**Notes**:
- Strategy document should contain task that we need to validate and graduate Task Execution Trigger Mechanism (covered in the previous round) to a more automated options
- Strategy document should contain task that we need to validate and graduate trigger mechanism to a more automated options
- Strategy document should contain task that we need to validate and graduate sufficient quality approach to more automation

---

Q9: Context Isolation Boundary

  You specified:
  "Each task must be executed in a standalone context"

  But the Mermaid diagram shows:
  C1: PVP generates both PVD + EP
  C2: EP generates both ED + PRP

  Question 9a: "task" = "generator execution" (Interpretation A)

  Question 9b: Should Epic Generator Prompt (produced in C1) have access to Product Vision Document (also produced in C1)?
  Answer: Yes, it must have access to PVD as one of the main C2 context components. Tries file system read on predefined location if possible. Ask human to confirm the location

---
Q10: Master Plan Scope

  Question 10a: 
  Answer: Option A (Task List)
  
  Question 10b: Should the Master Plan include validation criteria for each task?
  Answer: Yes. Rationale: it will clearly present a structured report of a task execution

**Notes**:
- Task List should be enumerated (TASK-001, TASK-002...) or with more structure in the name. Rationale: Argument for fixed execution prompt can be #TASK-001 or something like that. Prompt is configured to look up the task inside predefined file (TODO.md or MasterPlan.md)
- Master Plan should be a single point of truth for all future prompt executions.

---
Q11: Specialized CLAUDE.md Lifecycle

  Question 11a: Who creates specialized CLAUDE.md files?
  Answer: Scenario B (Lazy generation)

  Question 11b: What information goes in specialized CLAUDE.md vs. root CLAUDE.md?
  Answer: proposed split approved

**Notes**:
- If specialized CLAUDE.md does not exists, it prompts human that CLAUDE-*.md needs to be generated, goes into clarification loop, and proceeds with generation only upon confirmation

---
Dependency Mapping

  Question 12: Should each generator have read access to:
  Answer: Option A

**Notes**:

  > Backlog user stories transform high-level user stories into comprehensive, actionable specifications. Few high-level user stories are part of PRDs and new ones can be added at any point. Each backlog user
story, as defined in our strategy and in the user story template, contains implementation tasks. Context for those implementation tasks should contain the actual user story, tech spec and ADR for the successful
 code implementation. Is that you understanding as well or it is a different one?

⏺ You've identified a critical architectural clarification that affects the entire SDLC cascade structure. Let me analyze your understanding:

  Your Understanding

  PRD (contains few high-level user stories)
    ↓
  Backlog User Stories (detailed, actionable specs)
    ↓ (context for implementation)
  Tech Spec + ADR
    ↓
  Implementation Tasks (code generation)

  Key points you're making:
  1. PRDs contain high-level user stories
  2. Backlog user stories are separate, detailed expansions of those high-level stories
  3. Backlog user stories contain implementation tasks (not just acceptance criteria)
  4. Implementation context requires: User Story + Tech Spec + ADR (not just spec alone)
  5. New backlog stories can be added anytime (not just from initial PRD decomposition)

  Current Framework Understanding (From Mermaid Diagram)

  Product Vision → Epic → PRD → User Story → (ADR + Spec + Implementation Task)

  This shows:
  - User Story comes directly after PRD
  - ADR + Spec are siblings to Implementation Task at same level

  Gap Identified

  Critical discrepancy: The current cascade doesn't distinguish between:
  - High-level user stories (in PRD)
  - Backlog user stories (detailed, implementation-ready)

  Clarification Questions

  Q1: PRD User Stories vs. Backlog User Stories

  Are these two different artifact types?

  Option A (Two distinct types):
  - PRD User Stories: High-level, conceptual (e.g., "As a user, I want authentication")
  - Backlog User Stories: Detailed, sprint-ready (e.g., "As a user, I want to upload profile picture with validation, resizing, format conversion")

  Option B (Same type, different detail level):
  - PRD contains fully detailed user stories ready for backlog
  - No separate "backlog user story" artifact needed

  My interpretation of your statement: You mean Option A

  ---
  Q2: Implementation Tasks Location

  You said: "Each backlog user story contains implementation tasks"

  Does this mean:

  Option A (Tasks embedded in User Story doc):
  # Backlog User Story: Upload Profile Picture

  ## Technical Requirements
  - Frontend task 1: Create upload component
  - Backend task 1: Create POST /upload endpoint
  - Database task 1: Add profile_image_url column

  Option B (Tasks are separate artifacts):
  /artifacts/user_stories/upload_profile_pic_v3.md
  /artifacts/implementation_tasks/upload_component_task.md
  /artifacts/implementation_tasks/upload_endpoint_task.md

  My interpretation: You mean Option A (tasks embedded in user story, per template lines 1098-1099)

  ---
  Q3: Cascade Revision

  If I understand correctly, the cascade should be:

  Product Vision
    ↓ generates
  Epic (high-level features)
    ↓ generates
  PRD (contains high-level user stories)
    ↓ generates
  Backlog User Stories (detailed, with implementation tasks)
    ↓ (used as context for)
  Tech Spec + ADR generation
    ↓ (used as context for)
  Code Implementation

  Context assembly for code generation:
  - Load: Backlog User Story + Tech Spec + ADR
  - Generate: Implementation code

  Is this correct?

  ---
  Q4: Generator Chain Impact

  Current generator chain from Mermaid diagram:
  PRP (PRD Generator) → USP (User Story Generator)

  Should this be:

  Option A (PRD generates high-level stories, separate generator creates backlog stories):
  PRD Generator → outputs PRD with high-level stories
  Backlog Story Generator → inputs PRD, outputs detailed backlog stories
  Tech Spec Generator → inputs backlog story, outputs spec

  Option B (User Story Generator creates backlog-ready stories directly):
  PRD Generator → outputs PRD (no embedded stories)
  User Story Generator → inputs PRD, outputs backlog-ready stories
  Tech Spec Generator → inputs user story, outputs spec

  Which option aligns with your vision?

  ---
  Q5: Template Validation

  Looking at current /prompts/templates/user-story-template.xml:

  Lines 1098-1099:
  ## Technical Requirements
  - [Frontend task 1]
  - [Backend task 1]

  This suggests tasks ARE embedded in user story (supporting your understanding).

  But looking at PRD template (lines 676-680):
  ### Functional Requirements
  | ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |

  Question: Are these functional requirements the "high-level user stories" you mentioned, or something different?

  ---
  Proposed Revision (Based on Your Understanding)

  Updated Cascade

  C1: product-vision-generator
      ↓ outputs
  Product Vision + epic-generator

  C2: epic-generator
      ↓ outputs
  Epics + prd-generator

  C3: prd-generator
      ↓ outputs
  PRD (with high-level stories/requirements) + backlog-story-generator

  C4: backlog-story-generator
      ↓ outputs
  Detailed Backlog User Stories (with embedded implementation tasks) + tech-spec-generator

  C5: tech-spec-generator + adr-generator
      ↓ outputs
  Tech Specs + ADRs + code-generator

  C6: code-generator
      ↓ context: Backlog User Story + Tech Spec + ADR
      ↓ outputs
  Implementation Code + test-generator

  Key change: Added backlog-story-generator as separate phase between PRD and Tech Spec.

  ---
  Action Required

  Please confirm or correct:

  1. Are PRD stories and Backlog stories different artifacts? (Yes/No + explanation)
  2. Are implementation tasks embedded in user story docs? (Yes/No)
  3. Does code generation context need User Story + Tech Spec + ADR? (Yes/No)
  4. Should I revise the cascade in strategy document and Mermaid diagram? (Yes/No)
  5. Should I create a separate backlog-story-template.xml or rename user-story-template.xml?

  Once you confirm, I'll update:
  - /docs/context_engineering_strategy_v1.md (Section 2.3 Cascade Execution)
  - /TODO.md (add TASK-0XX for backlog story generation if needed)
  - Mermaid diagram in your original Q1 response
  - Generator prompt chain logic

  This is an excellent catch that ensures the framework matches real-world SDLC practices. 🎯


**Human Response**:
Q1: PRD User Stories vs. Backlog User Stories

Answer: Option A

**Rationale**:
- High-level user story is more orientied towards audience of product owners and stakeholders, which are focused on more details. Backlog user story is critical and detailed input data for ADRs, Tech Spec creation, and final Implementation Tasks definition. Software engineer and/or coding AI agent must have access to backlog user story, related ADRs, tech spec and implementation task content. This content together gives enough information to implementation team to understand scope, audience, success metrics, acceptance criteria, and the clear goal. It states the *who*, *what*, *why*, and *how* explicitly.

---
Q2: Implementation Tasks Location

Answer: Option A + checkbox

**Rationale**:
- Each backlog user story needs to be a live system. It lists the implementation tasks, but it needs to track their status as well. We can start by having simple checkbox (TODO list kind)
- Second phase is to store each backlog user story and task to a proper backlog tracking system (e.g. JIRA)
- **IMPORTANT** Second phase should be part of graduation cycle of Master Plan

---
Q3: Cascade Revision

Answer: yes, you understood correctly. Context assembly for code generation:
  - Input: Backlog User Story + Tech Spec + ADR
  - Goal: Implementation Task definition/title
  - Generate: Implementation code

---
Q4: Generator Chain Impact

Answer: Option A (PRD generates high-level stories, separate generator creates backlog stories)

**Notes**:
- Each high-level user story within PRD needs to be tracked. We can start with simple checkbox, which gives us a status of `Processed`, meaning the user story was given to the Backlog User Story Generator and it was distilled to backlog user stories for further processing.
- Each backlog user stories has its own subfolder with artifacts

**Rationale**:
- Backlog User Story Generator gets high-level user story and generates detailed backlog story. This gives us the option to just use Backlog User Story Generator for adding new simple high-level stories without a need to always create PRD (software enhancements, bug fixes, minor updates)

---
Q5: Template Validation

Answer: both sections are `Functional Requirements`. Please update `user-story-template.xml` for clarity. We also need section for non-functional requirements in both documents, if missing.

**Notes**:
- `/prompts/templates/user-story-template.xml` is backlog user story template
- `Functional Requirements` within PRD reflect on the requirements for all high-level user stories in general, like an overview

**Rationale**:
- Implementation team requires functional and non-functional requirements for proper code generation. The team only has access to backlog user story, ADR, Tech Spec and implementation task (as a final task goal). If baclog user story is missing non-functional requirements we will reach a context gap during implementation.

---
Proposed Revision needs corrections:
- C6 is currently out of the scope. We will handle that section separately. Focus of this context is document generation realm.
- C5 should output Tech Specs + ADRs, without code-generator

**CRITICAL** Analyze my response, and perform clarification loop by potentially asking questions until clear strategy/workflow is established

## Step 3

⏺ Clarification Loop Round 3: Document Generation Realm Deep Dive

  Analysis of Your Responses

  Excellent clarifications! I've identified several critical refinements needed. Let me validate my understanding and ask targeted questions:

  ---
  Validated Understanding

  ✅ Confirmed Architecture

  C1: Product Vision Generator
      ↓
  Product Vision + Epic Generator

  C2: Epic Generator
      ↓
  Epics + PRD Generator

  C3: PRD Generator
      ↓
  PRD (with high-level user stories + checkboxes) + Backlog Story Generator

  C4: Backlog Story Generator (per high-level story)
      ↓
  Detailed Backlog User Story (with implementation task checkboxes) + Tech Spec Generator + ADR Generator

  C5: Tech Spec Generator + ADR Generator
      ↓
  Tech Specs + ADRs (END OF DOCUMENT GENERATION REALM)

  [C6+ Code Generation - OUT OF SCOPE for this context]

  ---
  Critical Clarification Questions

  Q1: Backlog Story Generator Invocation Pattern

  You stated:
  "Backlog User Story Generator gets high-level user story and generates detailed backlog story"

  Scenario: PRD contains 5 high-level user stories

  Option A (One generator execution per high-level story):
  PRD with 5 high-level stories
    ↓
  Run: backlog-story-generator for story #1 → outputs 1 backlog story
  Run: backlog-story-generator for story #2 → outputs 1 backlog story
  Run: backlog-story-generator for story #3 → outputs 1 backlog story
  [etc...]

  Option B (One generator execution processes all):
  PRD with 5 high-level stories
    ↓
  Run: backlog-story-generator once → outputs 5 backlog stories (1 per high-level story)

  Option C (1:N relationship - one high-level story can spawn multiple backlog stories):
  PRD with 5 high-level stories
    ↓
  Run: backlog-story-generator for story #1 → outputs 3 detailed backlog stories
  Run: backlog-story-generator for story #2 → outputs 2 detailed backlog stories
  [etc...]
  Total: 12 backlog stories from 5 high-level stories

  Which option? And if Option C, how does generator decide to split one high-level story into multiple backlog stories?

  ---
  Q2: PRD High-Level User Story Format

  You said:
  "Each high-level user story within PRD needs to be tracked. We can start with simple checkbox"

  Current PRD Template (lines 676-680):
  ### Functional Requirements
  | ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
  |----|-------------|----------|-------------------|
  | FR-01 | [Requirement] | Must-have | [Criteria] |

  Question 2a: Are these "Functional Requirements" actually the high-level user stories, or are they separate?

  Option A (FR table IS the high-level stories):
  ### Functional Requirements / High-Level User Stories
  | ID | Story | Priority | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
  |----|-------|----------|-------------------|--------|
  | FR-01 | As admin, I want to manage users | Must-have | [Criteria] | ☐ Processed |
  | FR-02 | As user, I want to upload files | Must-have | [Criteria] | ☐ Processed |

  Option B (Separate section for high-level user stories):
  ### Functional Requirements
  [Technical requirements table as-is]

  ### High-Level User Stories
  | ID | User Story | Priority | Status |
  |----|------------|----------|--------|
  | US-01 | As admin, I want to manage users | Must-have | ☐ Processed |
  | US-02 | As user, I want to upload files | Must-have | ☐ Processed |

  Which structure?

  Question 2b: What does "Processed" checkbox mean exactly?
  - ☐ = Not yet sent to Backlog Story Generator
  - ☑ = Sent to Backlog Story Generator and backlog story created
  - Or different states (Pending → In Progress → Processed)?

  ---
  Q3: Backlog User Story Subfolder Structure

  You noted:
  "Each backlog user stories has its own subfolder with artifacts"

  Scenario: High-level story "User Authentication" spawns 3 backlog stories:
  1. User Registration
  2. User Login
  3. Password Reset

  Option A (Flat structure with prefixes):
  /artifacts/backlog_stories/
    ├── auth_user_registration_v3.md
    ├── auth_user_login_v3.md
    ├── auth_password_reset_v3.md

  Option B (Subfolder per high-level story):
  /artifacts/backlog_stories/
    └── US-01_user_authentication/
        ├── backlog_story_registration_v3.md
        ├── backlog_story_login_v3.md
        ├── backlog_story_password_reset_v3.md
        ├── tech_specs/
        │   ├── registration_spec_v3.md
        │   ├── login_spec_v3.md
        └── adrs/
            ├── adr_001_password_hashing.md

  Option C (Subfolder per backlog story):
  /artifacts/backlog_stories/
    ├── US-01-01_user_registration/
    │   ├── backlog_story_v3.md
    │   ├── tech_spec_v3.md
    │   ├── adr_001_password_hashing.md
    │   └── implementation_tasks.md (separate checklist file?)
    ├── US-01-02_user_login/
    │   ├── backlog_story_v3.md
    │   ├── tech_spec_v3.md
    └── US-01-03_password_reset/

  Which folder structure?

  ---
  Q4: Implementation Tasks Within Backlog Story

  You confirmed Option A (tasks embedded in backlog story doc) with checkboxes.

  Current User Story Template (lines 1098-1099):
  ## Technical Requirements
  - [Frontend task 1]
  - [Backend task 1]

  Question 4a: Should this be renamed/restructured?

  Proposed Structure:
  ## Technical Requirements
  [Overview of technical changes needed]

  ## Implementation Tasks
  - [ ] **TASK-001**: Frontend - Create upload component
    - Estimate: 5 story points
    - Dependencies: None
    - Assigned: [Developer name or TBD]
  - [ ] **TASK-002**: Backend - Create POST /upload endpoint
    - Estimate: 3 story points
    - Dependencies: TASK-003 (database schema)
  - [ ] **TASK-003**: Database - Add profile_image_url column
    - Estimate: 2 story points
    - Dependencies: None

  Is this the right format? Or simpler?

  Question 4b: What does checked task mean?
  - ☑ = Code implementation complete?
  - ☑ = Task definition reviewed and approved?
  - Different meaning?

  ---
  Q5: Tech Spec and ADR Generator Relationship

  You said:
  "C5 should output Tech Specs + ADRs, without code-generator"

  Question 5a: Are Tech Spec and ADR generated together or separately?

  Option A (Single generator, dual outputs):
  C5: tech_and_adr-generator.xml
      ↓
  Inputs: Backlog User Story
  Outputs: Tech Spec + ADR(s) + [nothing - end of doc realm]

  Option B (Parallel generators):
  C5a: tech-spec-generator.xml
      ↓
  Inputs: Backlog User Story
  Outputs: Tech Spec

  C5b: adr-generator.xml
      ↓
  Inputs: Backlog User Story + Tech Spec (from C5a)
  Outputs: ADR(s)

  Option C (Sequential, ADR first):
  C5a: adr-generator.xml
      ↓
  Inputs: Backlog User Story
  Outputs: ADR(s) + Tech Spec Generator

  C5b: tech-spec-generator.xml
      ↓
  Inputs: Backlog User Story + ADR(s)
  Outputs: Tech Spec

  Which option? And if Option B or C, what determines the order?

  Question 5b: Can one backlog story generate multiple ADRs?

  Example: "User Authentication" backlog story might need:
  - ADR-001: Password hashing algorithm (bcrypt vs argon2)
  - ADR-002: Session management (JWT vs server-side sessions)
  - ADR-003: MFA implementation (TOTP vs SMS)

  If yes, how does generator know how many ADRs to create?

  ---
  Q6: Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements

  You noted:
  "We also need section for non-functional requirements in both documents, if missing"

  Question 6a: Should PRD template be updated?

  Current PRD Template (lines 682-686):
  ### Non-Functional Requirements
  - **Performance:** [specific targets]
  - **Security:** [requirements]
  - **Scalability:** [targets]
  - **Accessibility:** [WCAG standards]

  This exists already - do you want more detail/structure? Or is this sufficient?

  Question 6b: For backlog user story template, add this structure?

  Proposed Addition:
  ## Functional Requirements
  [User-facing features and behaviors]

  ## Non-Functional Requirements
  - **Performance:** [Response time, throughput targets]
  - **Security:** [Auth, encryption, input validation]
  - **Scalability:** [Concurrent user targets]
  - **Reliability:** [Uptime, error handling]
  - **Accessibility:** [WCAG compliance level]
  - **Maintainability:** [Code quality, documentation standards]

  Is this correct? Or different structure?

  ---
  Q7: Phase 2 Graduation - JIRA Integration

  You mentioned:
  "Second phase is to store each backlog user story and task to a proper backlog tracking system (e.g. JIRA)"

  Question 7a: Should this be added to TODO.md as a task?

  Proposed Task:
  ### TASK-0XX: Design JIRA Integration Strategy
  **Priority**: Medium
  **Dependencies**: TASK-013 (PRD v3 complete)
  **Phase**: 5 (Validation & Graduation)
  **Status**: ⏳ Pending

  **Description**:
  Define strategy for exporting backlog user stories and implementation tasks to JIRA.

  **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] Document JIRA field mapping (backlog story → JIRA issue)
  - [ ] Define automation approach (API vs manual export)
  - [ ] Create JIRA issue template matching backlog story structure
  - [ ] Prototype export script (if automated)
  - [ ] Add to Phase 2 graduation criteria in strategy doc

  Should I add this now? Or defer until after initial cascade is validated?

  ---
  Q8: Generator Outputs at End of Document Realm

  You clarified:
  "C5 should output Tech Specs + ADRs, without code-generator"

  Question: Since C5 is the last step in document generation realm, do Tech Spec/ADR generators output:

  Option A (No next-level generator):
  tech-spec-generator.xml outputs:
  - Tech Spec v3.md
  - (nothing else - end of chain)

  Option B (Placeholder/stub for future code generation):
  tech-spec-generator.xml outputs:
  - Tech Spec v3.md
  - code-generator_stub.xml (empty/commented for Phase 2)

  Option C (Documentation that code gen is next):
  tech-spec-generator.xml outputs:
  - Tech Spec v3.md
  - implementation_context.md (lists: backlog story, tech spec, ADRs for code gen)

  Which approach?

  ---
  Proposed Revised Cascade (Pending Your Answers)

  C1: Product Vision Generator
      Input: product-idea.md
      Output: product_vision_v3.md + epic-generator.xml

  C2: Epic Generator
      Input: product_vision_v3.md
      Output: epic_001_v3.md ... epic_00N_v3.md + prd-generator.xml

  C3: PRD Generator
      Input: epic_001_v3.md
      Output: prd_v3.md (with high-level user stories + ☐ checkboxes) + backlog-story-generator.xml

  C4: Backlog Story Generator (per high-level story)
      Input: prd_v3.md (specific high-level story)
      Output: backlog_story_v3.md (with impl. task ☐ checkboxes) + tech-spec-generator.xml + adr-generator.xml

  C5: Tech Spec + ADR Generators (details TBD from Q5)
      Input: backlog_story_v3.md
      Output: tech_spec_v3.md + adr_001.md ... adr_00N.md
      [END OF DOCUMENT GENERATION REALM]

  ---
  Status: Paused at Clarification Round 3, awaiting Q1-Q8 responses to finalize document generation realm architecture.

**Human Response**:

Validated Understanding Section

Answer: your understanding of my previous statements is excellent. I changed my mind on a minor issue. Instead of placing checkboxes within PRD for high-level user story status tracking and within Backlog User Story for implementation task status tracking I would prefer to place those checkboxes in a separate TODO.md tracking file in the same subfolder as a parent file.

**Rationale**:
- We do not want to clutter and constantly update final documentation/specification files. These files are going through a manual revision process and should be freezed upon approval.

---
Q1: Backlog Story Generator Invocation Pattern

Answer: Option B + Option C
**Explanation**: 
- backlog-story-generator should process multiple high-level user stories coming from the same PRD. Backlog story generator requires access to PRD to properly generate backlog user stories.  
- one high-level user story can spawn multiple backlog stories. backlog-story-generator can do a deep analysis and research and decide to have multiple backlog stories for a corresponding high-level story
- there is a case of minor changes (enhancements, bug fixes, etc) where we want to generate backlog user story but we do not have a full PRD for it. That is also a valid use case

Q2: PRD High-Level User Story Format

Question 2a:
- Functional requirements are separate from high-level user stories. There should be a reference between high-level user story and function requirement(s) (e.g. story STR-001 satisfies FR-3)
- Functional requirements are contained within PRD and related backlog user story. Backlog user story should clearly state what functional requirement it covers from related PRD, if available. 
- As previously stated, we will track status of high-level user stories and implementation tasks as part of a separate tracking TODO.md file

Question 2b: What does "Processed" checkbox mean exactly?
Answer:
  - ☐ = Not yet sent to Backlog Story Generator
  - ☑ = Sent to Backlog Story Generator and backlog story created

---
Q3: Backlog User Story Subfolder Structure

Answer: Option C

**Note**: 
- Subfolder for backlog use story contains TODO.md file to track implementation task status

---
Q4: Implementation Tasks Within Backlog Story

Question 4a: Should this be renamed/restructured?
Answer: No, keep it as is withing backlog user story. Put the details within TODO.md tracking file

To clarify the answer, content of TODO.md file should be:
```
  ## Implementation Tasks
  - [ ] **TASK-001**: Frontend - Create upload component
    - Estimate: 5 story points
    - Dependencies: None
    - Assigned: [Developer name or TBD]
  - [ ] **TASK-002**: Backend - Create POST /upload endpoint
    - Estimate: 3 story points
    - Dependencies: TASK-003 (database schema)
  - [ ] **TASK-003**: Database - Add profile_image_url column
    - Estimate: 2 story points
    - Dependencies: None
```
, content of backlog story doc (tasks section)
  ## Functional Requirements
  - [Frontend task 1]
  - [Backend task 1]

Question 4b: What does checked task mean?
- ☑ = Task sent for further processing 

**Notes**:
- we can keep it a bit generic for this documentation strategy phase

---
Q5: Tech Spec and ADR Generator Relationship

Question 5a: Are Tech Spec and ADR generated together or separately?
Answer: Option C

**Rationale**:
- ADRs are generated when required
- Backlog generator should suggest:
  - existing ADR
  - creation of new ADR (clarification loop + recommendations + confirmation + generation)
- Tech Specs are required to be generated (clarification loop + recommendations + confirmation + generation)

**Notes**:
- We need to inspect the notion of sharing Tech Specs in the future as part of our graduation process for the master workflow

Question 5b: Can one backlog story generate multiple ADRs?
Answer: Yes, generator can potentially create multiple ADRs. Defining the quantity and content of ADRs will be part of iterative process (clarification loop + recommendations + confirmation + generation)

---
Q6: Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements

Question 6a: Should PRD template be updated?
Answer: No, it is good enough

Question 6b: For backlog user story template, add this structure?
Answer: Proposed non-requirements structure is good

---
Q7: Phase 2 Graduation - JIRA Integration

Question 7a: Should this be added to TODO.md as a task?
Answer: yes, it should be added to GRADUATION.md, not TODO.md. Defer until after initial cascade is validated, but make sure it is accessible within the next phase context

**Note**:
- Make separate GRADUATION.md file for these concerns. I specify several of the remark within my past statements. Keep enough context for each graduation task for the future sessions/contexts

**Rationale**:
- This current session (context) will soon expire. All the future progress/graduation should be part of new sessions/contexts
- We should not clutter main TODO.md. Separation of tasks will add better clarity

---
Q8: Generator Outputs at End of Document Realm
Answer: Option C. It output Tech Spec, potentially ADR(s) and implementation context as part of the implementation task TODO.md track file with checkboxes

**Notes**:
- implementation context keep references only to related files. DO NOT paste the entire content of the files

---
Proposed Revised Cascade

My corrections:
C1: Product Vision Generator
    Input: product-idea.md
    Output: product_vision_v3.md + epic-generator.xml

C2: Epic Generator
    Input: product_vision_v3.md
    Output: epic_001_v3.md ... epic_00N_v3.md + prd-generator.xml

C3: PRD Generator
    Input: epic_001_v3.md
    Output: prd_v3.md (with high-level user stories) + backlog-story-generator.xml
    **Change**:  ☐ checkboxes are placed in TODO.md file in PRD subfolder

C4: Backlog Story Generator (per high-level story)
    Input: prd_v3.md (specific high-level story)
    Output: backlog_story_v3.md (with impl. task) + tech-spec-generator + adr-generator
    **Changes**:  
    - ☐ checkboxes are placed in TODO.md file in Backlog story subfolder
    - PRD as input for backlog story generator as most likely, but optional for minor changes. specific high-level story is required.

C5: Tech Spec + ADR Generators (details TBD from Q5)
    Input: backlog_story_v3.md
    Output: tech_spec_v3.md + adr_001.md ... adr_00N.md

## Step 4

⏺ Clarification Loop Round 4: Final Architecture Validation

  Analysis of Your Responses

  Excellent! Your clarifications have solidified the architecture significantly. I have a few remaining questions to ensure 100% alignment, then I'll proceed with updates.

  ---
  ✅ Confirmed Architectural Changes

  Key Paradigm Shift: TODO.md as Status Tracking

  - PRD: High-level user stories → tracked in /artifacts/prds/epic_001/TODO.md
  - Backlog Story: Implementation tasks → tracked in /artifacts/backlog_stories/US-01-01_user_registration/TODO.md
  - Benefit: Preserves artifact immutability after approval

  Finalized Cascade

  C1: product-vision-generator
      ↓
  product_vision_v3.md + epic-generator.xml

  C2: epic-generator
      ↓
  epic_001_v3.md ... epic_00N_v3.md + prd-generator.xml

  C3: prd-generator (per epic)
      ↓
  prd_v3.md + TODO.md (tracks high-level stories) + backlog-story-generator.xml

  C4: backlog-story-generator
      ↓ (processes multiple high-level stories from PRD, can split 1:N)
  backlog_story_v3.md + TODO.md (tracks impl tasks) + adr-generator.xml

  C5a: adr-generator (optional, clarification loop)
      ↓
  adr_001.md ... adr_00N.md + tech-spec-generator.xml

  C5b: tech-spec-generator
      ↓
  tech_spec_v3.md + TODO.md (implementation context with references)

  Remaining Clarification Questions

  Q1: PRD Subfolder Structure

  You said:
  "☐ checkboxes are placed in TODO.md file in PRD subfolder"

  Question: What is the PRD subfolder structure?

  Option A (PRD per epic):
  /artifacts/prds/
    ├── epic_001_user_authentication/
    │   ├── prd_v3.md
    │   └── TODO.md (tracks high-level stories from this PRD)
    ├── epic_002_file_management/
    │   ├── prd_v3.md
    │   └── TODO.md

  Option B (Flat PRD with epic prefix):
  /artifacts/prds/
    ├── epic_001_prd_v3.md
    ├── epic_001_TODO.md
    ├── epic_002_prd_v3.md
    ├── epic_002_TODO.md

  Which structure?

  ---
  Q2: TODO.md Content Format for High-Level Stories

  Scenario: PRD has 3 high-level user stories

  Option A (Simple checklist):
  # PRD High-Level User Stories Status

  - [ ] **US-01**: As admin, I want to manage users
    - Functional Requirements: FR-01, FR-03
    - Priority: Must-have
    - Backlog Stories Generated: (none yet)

  - [ ] **US-02**: As user, I want to upload files
    - Functional Requirements: FR-02, FR-05
    - Priority: Must-have
    - Backlog Stories Generated: (none yet)

  - [ ] **US-03**: As user, I want to share files
    - Functional Requirements: FR-06, FR-07
    - Priority: Should-have
    - Backlog Stories Generated: (none yet)

  Option B (Table format):
  # PRD High-Level User Stories Status

  | ID | User Story | FRs | Priority | Status | Backlog Stories |
  |----|------------|-----|----------|--------|----------------|
  | ☐ US-01 | As admin, I want to manage users | FR-01, FR-03 | Must-have | Pending | - |
  | ☐ US-02 | As user, I want to upload files | FR-02, FR-05 | Must-have | Pending | - |
  | ☐ US-03 | As user, I want to share files | FR-06, FR-07 | Should-have | Pending | - |

  Option C (Detailed with backlog story links):
  # PRD High-Level User Stories Status

  ## US-01: User Management
  - **Status**: ☑ Processed
  - **Functional Requirements**: FR-01, FR-03
  - **Priority**: Must-have
  - **Backlog Stories Generated**:
    - [BS-01-01: User Registration](/artifacts/backlog_stories/US-01-01_user_registration/)
    - [BS-01-02: User Profile Management](/artifacts/backlog_stories/US-01-02_user_profile/)
    - [BS-01-03: User Deletion](/artifacts/backlog_stories/US-01-03_user_deletion/)

  ## US-02: File Upload
  - **Status**: ☐ Pending
  - **Functional Requirements**: FR-02, FR-05
  - **Priority**: Must-have
  - **Backlog Stories Generated**: (none yet)

  Which format? (Or propose different structure)

  Question 2b: When high-level story US-01 spawns 3 backlog stories, how/when is TODO.md updated?
  - Manually by human after reviewing backlog stories?
  - Automatically by backlog-story-generator as final step?

  ---
  Q3: Backlog Story Generator Input Specification

  You clarified:
  "PRD as input for backlog story generator as most likely, but optional for minor changes. specific high-level story is required."

  Question 3a: How does generator know which high-level story to process?

  Option A (Explicit argument):
  /kickoff execute-generator TASK-008 --story-id=US-02

  Option B (Human pastes story into generator context):
  # In backlog-story-generator.xml execution context

  <input_artifacts>
    <artifact path="/artifacts/prds/epic_001/prd_v3.md" type="prd">
      Full PRD content
    </artifact>
    <target_story>US-02</target_story>
  </input_artifacts>

  Option C (Generator processes all unprocessed stories):
  Generator reads /artifacts/prds/epic_001/TODO.md
  Finds all stories with ☐ status
  Generates backlog stories for each
  Updates TODO.md with ☑ status

  Which approach?

  Question 3b: For "minor changes without PRD" use case, what is the input?

  Example: Bug fix backlog story generation

  Option A (Minimal input file):
  # Input: /docs/minor-enhancement-US-099.md

  **High-Level Story**: As developer, I want CLI to support --verbose flag for debugging

  **Functional Requirements**:
  - FR-99: CLI must output detailed logs when --verbose flag is set

  **Priority**: Should-have

  **Context**: Enhancement request from user feedback

  Option B (Direct prompt without PRD):
  Human runs: /kickoff execute-generator backlog-story-generator
  Provides story inline: "As developer, I want CLI to support --verbose flag"
  Generator creates backlog story without PRD reference

  Which approach for minor changes?

  ---
  Q4: ADR Generator Clarification Loop

  You stated:
  "Backlog generator should suggest: existing ADR, creation of new ADR (clarification loop + recommendations + confirmation + generation)"

  Question 4a: Where does ADR suggestion happen?

  Option A (Backlog Story Generator suggests ADRs):
  backlog-story-generator.xml execution:
  1. Generate backlog story content
  2. Analyze if architectural decisions needed
  3. Output in backlog_story_v1.md:

     ## Architectural Decisions Required
     - [ ] ADR needed: Password hashing algorithm (bcrypt vs argon2)
       - Recommendation: bcrypt (industry standard, team familiar)
       - Confirmation required: Yes
     - [ ] ADR needed: Session management approach
       - Recommendation: JWT (stateless, scales better)
     - [ ] Use existing ADR-005: Database connection pooling

  4. Generate adr-generator.xml with guidance for suggested ADRs

  Option B (Separate ADR analysis step):
  After backlog story v3 approved:
  Human runs: /kickoff analyze-adr-needs backlog_story_v3.md
  System outputs ADR recommendations
  Human confirms which to generate
  System generates adr-generator.xml with confirmed ADRs

  Option C (ADR generator does analysis):
  adr-generator.xml execution:
  1. Read backlog story
  2. Identify decision points (clarification loop)
  3. Prompt human: "Found 3 decision points. Generate ADRs for which? [1,2,3/all/none]"
  4. Human confirms
  5. Generate selected ADRs

  Which option? (This affects whether adr-generator is always created or conditionally)

  Question 4b: If no ADRs needed, does backlog story generator still output adr-generator.xml?

  Option A (Always generate, may be no-op):
  adr-generator.xml exists but contains:
  <instructions>
    No architectural decisions required for this backlog story.
    Proceed directly to tech-spec-generator.xml
  </instructions>

  Option B (Conditional output):
  backlog-story-generator.xml outputs:
  - backlog_story_v3.md
  - TODO.md
  - adr-generator.xml (ONLY if ADRs needed)
  - tech-spec-generator.xml (if no ADRs needed)

  Which approach?

  ---
  Q5: Tech Spec TODO.md Implementation Context

  You clarified:
  "implementation context keep references only to related files. DO NOT paste the entire content"

  Question: What does implementation context TODO.md look like?

  Proposed Format:
  # Implementation Context for User Registration Feature

  ## Related Artifacts (References Only)

  ### Backlog User Story
  **Path**: `/artifacts/backlog_stories/US-01-01_user_registration/backlog_story_v3.md`
  **Key Requirements**:
  - User registration with email/password
  - Email verification required
  - Password strength validation

  ### Technical Specification
  **Path**: `/artifacts/backlog_stories/US-01-01_user_registration/tech_spec_v3.md`
  **Key Decisions**:
  - API endpoint: POST /api/v1/users/register
  - Database: users table with email, password_hash, verified columns
  - Email service: SendGrid integration

  ### Architecture Decision Records
  1. **ADR-001**: Password Hashing Algorithm
     **Path**: `/artifacts/backlog_stories/US-01-01_user_registration/adr_001_password_hashing.md`
     **Decision**: Use bcrypt with salt rounds=10

  2. **ADR-002**: Email Verification Strategy
     **Path**: `/artifacts/backlog_stories/US-01-01_user_registration/adr_002_email_verification.md`
     **Decision**: Time-limited tokens (24hr expiry)

  ## Implementation Tasks (from backlog story TODO.md)
  - [ ] TASK-001: Create users database table
  - [ ] TASK-002: Implement registration API endpoint
  - [ ] TASK-003: Email verification service
  - [ ] TASK-004: Frontend registration form

  ## Next Steps for Code Generation Phase
  1. Load all referenced artifacts above
  2. Review implementation tasks
  3. Generate code for each task sequentially
  4. Run tests and validate against acceptance criteria

  ---
  **Note**: This file marks END OF DOCUMENT GENERATION REALM.
  Code generation will be handled in separate context/phase.

  Is this the right format? Or different structure?

  ---
  Q6: GRADUATION.md Structure and Location

  You specified:
  "Make separate GRADUATION.md file for these concerns... Keep enough context for each graduation task for the future sessions/contexts"

  Question 6a: Where should GRADUATION.md be located?

  Option A (Root level):
  /GRADUATION.md
  /TODO.md
  /CLAUDE.md

  Option B (Docs folder):
  /docs/GRADUATION.md
  /docs/context_engineering_strategy_v1.md

  Option C (Separate graduation folder):
  /graduation/
    ├── GRADUATION.md
    ├── phase2_criteria.md
    └── phase3_vision.md

  Which location?

  Question 6b: What content should GRADUATION.md contain now?

  Proposed Initial Structure:
  # Context Engineering Framework - Graduation Tasks

  **Purpose**: Track maturity progression from Phase 1 (Manual) → Phase 2 (Semi-Automated) → Phase 3 (Fully Automated)

  **Current Phase**: Phase 1 (Manual)
  **Last Updated**: 2025-10-07

  ---

  ## Phase 2 Graduation Criteria

  Must complete before advancing to Phase 2:
  - [ ] Complete 1 full SDLC cascade (Vision → Tech Spec/ADR)
  - [ ] Validate 3-iteration refinement on ≥3 different generators
  - [ ] Document ≥5 lessons learned in strategy doc Section 8

  ---

  ## Phase 2 Enhancement Tasks

  ### GRAD-001: JIRA Integration Strategy
  **Priority**: Medium
  **Context**: Automate export of backlog stories and implementation tasks to JIRA
  **Requirements**:
  - Document JIRA field mapping (backlog story → JIRA issue)
  - Define automation approach (API vs manual export)
  - Create JIRA issue template matching backlog story structure
  - Prototype export script

  ### GRAD-002: Shared Tech Spec Repository
  **Priority**: Medium
  **Context**: [From Q5a Note - "inspect notion of sharing Tech Specs"]
  **Requirements**:
  - Define when/how tech specs can be reused across backlog stories
  - Create tech spec discovery/search mechanism
  - Implement versioning for shared specs
  - Document reuse patterns

  ### GRAD-003: Automated Execution Script
  **Priority**: High
  **Context**: Reduce manual task lookup from TODO.md
  **Requirements**:
  - Script parses TODO.md and executes tasks sequentially
  - Human approval checkpoints at iteration boundaries
  - Automated context assembly based on dependencies

  ### GRAD-004: Self-Critique Loops
  **Priority**: High
  **Context**: Implement Chain-of-Verification for automated refinement
  **Requirements**:
  - Create artifact_critique_agent.xml
  - Integrate with refine-generator command
  - Set quality threshold (80%) for auto-approval

  ---

  ## Phase 3 Vision (Future)

  [To be defined after Phase 2 completion]

  ---

  **Note**: Each graduation task should be addressable in future contexts with sufficient information to proceed without re-reading entire conversation history.

  Is this structure correct? What else should be included?

  Summary of Unanswered Questions

  Total: 7 main questions with sub-parts
  1. Q1: PRD subfolder structure (Option A vs B)
  2. Q2: TODO.md format for high-level stories (Option A/B/C) + update mechanism
  3. Q3: Backlog generator input specification (how to target specific story) + minor change input format
  4. Q4: ADR clarification loop location (where suggestion happens) + conditional adr-generator output
  5. Q5: Implementation context TODO.md format validation

  ---
  Status: Paused at Clarification Round 4, awaiting Q1-Q7 responses to finalize all architectural details before generating updates.

**Human Response**:
Q1: PRD Subfolder Structure
Question: What is the PRD subfolder structure?
Answer: Option A (Flat PRD with epic prefix)

**Note**:
- PRD must have their on numbering scheme (prd_003_jwt_authentication_v3.md)

---
Q2: TODO.md Content Format for High-Level Stories
Question 2a:
Answer: Option A, without backlog stories references

**Rationale**:
- Backlog user story refers to high-level user story. No need for bi-directional references

Question 2b: When high-level story US-01 spawns 3 backlog stories, how/when is TODO.md updated?
Answer: No update. Only backlog user stories reference high-level user story

---
Q3: Backlog Story Generator Input Specification

Question 3a: How does generator know which high-level story to process?
Answer: Option A. Human needs to manually add new high-level stories to the TODO.md file within PRD folder. PRD Functional Requirement section can update with manual addition of new high-level stories

**Notes**:
- Use PRD-008 instead of TASK-008 as a reference. Avoid confusion
- I changed the spec for backlog story generator. Let's make it mandatory to specify PRD as input for Backlog Story Generator
- We need to revisit this decision as part of graduation process

Question 3b: For "minor changes without PRD" use case, what is the input?
Answer: clarified in answer for question 3b

---
Q4: ADR Generator Clarification Loop
Question 4a: Where does ADR suggestion happen?
Answer: Option A
Question 4b: If no ADRs needed, does backlog story generator still output adr-generator.xml?
Answer: Option A

**Rationale**: Better for consistency of folder structure

---
Q5: Tech Spec TODO.md Implementation Context
Answer: proposed file format accepted

---
Q6: GRADUATION.md Structure and Location

  You specified:
  "Make separate GRADUATION.md file for these concerns... Keep enough context for each graduation task for the future sessions/contexts"

Question 6a: Where should GRADUATION.md be located?
Answer: Option B

**Notes**: All graduation files can reside in `/docs` folder

Question 6b: What content should GRADUATION.md contain now?
Answer: Proposed structure accepted

---
Q7: Updated Folder Structure

**Notes**:
- GRADUATION.md should be moved to /docs

Question 7a: Should /artifacts/specs/ folder be removed since specs are now in backlog story subfolders?
Answer: yes

Question 7b: 
Answer: deferred

  Remaining Updates (For Next Context)

  Due to context window constraints, the following updates are documented but not yet applied:

  A. /docs/context_engineering_strategy_v1.md Updates

  Section 2.3: Cascade Execution - Add C4 (Backlog Story Generator phase):
  ### 2.3.4 Phase 4: Backlog Story Generation (NEW)
  **Objective**: Transform high-level user stories from PRD into detailed, implementation-ready backlog stories

  **Execution Pattern**:
  - Input: PRD with high-level user stories (tracked in PRD/TODO.md)
  - Generator processes multiple stories (can split 1 high-level → N backlog stories)
  - Output: Backlog story subfolder per detailed story

  **Context Setup**:
  - /CLAUDE.md + /prompts/CLAUDE-backlog-story.md
  - /prompts/backlog-story-generator.xml
  - /prompts/templates/backlog-story-template.xml
  - /artifacts/prds/prd_XXX/prd_v3.md

  **Outputs**:
  - /artifacts/backlog_stories/US-XX-YY_feature/backlog_story_v3.md
  - /artifacts/backlog_stories/US-XX-YY_feature/TODO.md
  - /prompts/adr-generator.xml

  Section 3: Folder Structure Standard - Update with new structure (show above)

  Section 6.2-6.4: Execution Playbook - Add Phase 4 instructions

  Glossary - Add definitions:
  - High-Level User Story: Conceptual story in PRD, references functional requirements
  - Backlog User Story: Detailed, implementation-ready story with non-functional requirements, technical requirements, and tasks

  B. /TODO.md Major Updates

  Insert new tasks after TASK-013:

  ### TASK-014: Execute Backlog Story Generator v1 (US-01 from PRD)
  **Priority**: Critical
  **Dependencies**: TASK-013 (PRD v3 approved)
  **Estimated Time**: 25 minutes
  **Status**: ⏳ Pending
  **Context**: New session C4 required

  **Description**:
  Execute Backlog Story Generator for first high-level story from PRD.

  **Command**: `/kickoff execute-generator PRD-001 --story-id=US-01`

  **Context Requirements**:
  - /CLAUDE.md
  - /prompts/CLAUDE-backlog-story.md (lazy-generate if missing)
  - /prompts/backlog-story-generator.xml
  - /prompts/templates/backlog-story-template.xml
  - /artifacts/prds/prd_001/prd_v3.md

  **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] Backlog story follows template structure
  - [ ] Related PRD section populated (PRD ID, high-level story, FRs)
  - [ ] Functional requirements listed
  - [ ] Non-functional requirements defined (all 6 dimensions)
  - [ ] Technical requirements cover all layers
  - [ ] Acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format
  - [ ] TODO.md file created with implementation tasks
  - [ ] ADR generator prompt is valid XML
  - [ ] Traceability to PRD established

  **Output Artifacts**:
  - /artifacts/backlog_stories/US-01-01_feature/backlog_story_v1.md
  - /artifacts/backlog_stories/US-01-01_feature/TODO.md
  - /prompts/adr-generator.xml

  Renumber: TASK-014 → TASK-015, etc.

  C. /CLAUDE.md Updates

  Line 14: Update cascade description to include C4

  Lines 21-59: Update folder structure (use final structure above)

  Add section "TODO.md Tracking Files":
  ## TODO.md Tracking Files

  The framework uses separate TODO.md files to track status without cluttering frozen artifacts:

  ### PRD Level (`/artifacts/prds/prd_XXX/TODO.md`)
  Tracks high-level user stories:
  - ☐ = Not yet sent to Backlog Story Generator
  - ☑ = Sent to Backlog Story Generator, backlog stories created

  ### Backlog Story Level (`/artifacts/backlog_stories/US-XX-YY/TODO.md`)
  Tracks implementation tasks with estimates, dependencies, assignments.

  ### Why Separate Files?
  - Preserves artifact immutability after approval
  - Allows dynamic status updates without re-generating documents
  - Clear separation: specifications (frozen) vs. progress tracking (dynamic)

  ---
  Key Architectural Decisions Summary

  1. High-Level vs. Backlog Stories: Two distinct artifact types
    - High-level: In PRDs, conceptual, references FRs
    - Backlog: Detailed, implementation-ready, full tech requirements
  2. TODO.md Tracking: Separate files for status, not embedded in artifacts
    - PRD/TODO.md: High-level story status
    - Backlog Story/TODO.md: Implementation task status
  3. Backlog Story Generator: Processes multiple high-level stories, can split 1:N
  4. PRD Numbering: PRD-XXX scheme, file: prd_XXX_feature_name_vN.md
  5. ADR Generation: Optional, clarification loop, backlog generator suggests ADRs
  6. Tech Spec Context: implementation_context_TODO.md has references only (not full content)
  7. Graduation Tasks: Tracked in /docs/GRADUATION.md, not /TODO.md
  8. Document Realm End: Tech Spec + ADR (no code-generator in this phase)

  ---
  Next Session Action Items

  1. Apply strategy document updates (Sections 2.3, 3, 6, Glossary)
  2. Apply TODO.md updates (insert TASK-014+, renumber)
  3. Apply CLAUDE.md updates (cascade, folder structure, TODO.md section)
  4. Create backlog-story-generator.xml exemplar
  5. Execute TASK-003 (Product Vision Generator v1) to start validation

  ---
  Session Complete: Architecture finalized, templates updated, GRADUATION.md created
  Ready For: Next context to apply remaining documentation updates and begin execution phase

  Approval Process: Critique file created `feedback/context_engineering_strategy_v1_critique_v1.md`

  Clarification Questions

  On Q1 (Duplication):

  Q1.1: Should validation checklists only live in generators (and removed from templates), OR only in templates (and removed from generators)? What's your preference?

  On Q2 (Research):

  Q2.1: For Product Vision, should the generator explicitly instruct the LLM to research competitive solutions and suggest additional capabilities beyond what's in the product-idea.md?Q2.2: Should this research
   happen at Vision stage (initial broad research) OR Epic stage (feature-specific research) OR both?Q2.3: Do we need explicit research instructions like "Use WebSearch tool to find..." or rely on implicit LLM
  behavior?

  On Q3 (Background/Constraints):

  Q3.1: For "Reference" sections - do you want me to:
  - Option A: Extract relevant content inline (increases prompt size but self-contained)
  - Option B: Keep references as documentation only (agent won't load them)
  - Option C: Load specific sections on-demand via read instructions

  Q3.2: The 4 constraints in Product Vision generator - are these specific to the current CLI tool product or meant to be generic placeholders that should be replaced per-product? Should I mark them as
  [CUSTOMIZE PER PRODUCT]?

  On Q4 (Epic Generator XML Schema):

  Q4.1: Should I extract the XML schema template from strategy doc and create a standalone /prompts/templates/generator-schema.xml file that all generators reference?

  On Q5a-d (Command Names):

  Q5.1: You want to remove /kickoff prefix entirely and use direct commands like /execute-generator and /refine-generator? Should I update the .claude/commands/ XML files to register these as direct slash
  commands?

  On Q5c (Phase Tracking):

  Q5.2: Keep "Current Phase" section in CLAUDE.md as read-only (manual reference) and make TODO.md the single source of truth for status updates?

  On Q6 (Strategy Updates):

  Q6.1: Should I add a generator step that explicitly instructs agents to update strategy.md with lessons learned, OR is this a manual human task after each phase?

  On Q7d (Utility Commands):

  Q7.1: Should I create tasks in TODO.md to implement /validate-artifact and /update-phase commands, OR remove these references since they don't exist yet?

  On Remarks - MCP Server Phase:

  CRITICAL Q8: You propose inserting a new phase between PoC (Phase 1) and current Phase 2. This would:
  - Make current Phase 2→3, Phase 3→4, Phase 4→5
  - Add new Phase 2: "MCP Server Extraction & Productization"

  Q8.1: Should this new MCP phase happen after completing the current PoC (i.e., after we've executed Product Vision/Epic/PRD generators at least once), OR immediately after template extraction?

  Q8.2: For the MCP Server - do you want a Python/FastMCP implementation, OR a different MCP framework?

  On TODO.md → PLAN.md Rename:

  Q9: Rename affects many file references. Should I:
  - Rename now (requires updating CLAUDE.md, strategy doc, all prompts)
  - Rename after Phase 1 completion
  - Keep TODO.md name for consistency with common conventions

  **Human Response**

  On Q1 (Duplication):

  Q1.1: Only in generators. **Rationale**: Templates should not contain validations. They should only define structure

  On Q2 (Research):

  Q2.1: Yes
  Q2.2: It should happen as part of vision, epic and prd phases?
  Q2.3: Implicit LLM behavior

  On Q3 (Background/Constraints):

  Q3.1: Option B

  Q3.2: [CUSTOMIZE PER PRODUCT]

  On Q4 (Epic Generator XML Schema):

  Q4.1: Yes

  On Q5a-d (Command Names):

  Q5.1: Yes

  On Q5c (Phase Tracking):

  Q5.2: Remove from CLAUDE.md and keep it only in TODO.md

  On Q6 (Strategy Updates):

  Q6.1: Make it part of Phase Report and clearly instruct human to do the manual update

  On Q7d (Utility Commands):

  Q7.1: Remove

  On Remarks - MCP Server Phase:

  CRITICAL Q8: We need to clarify phases. My understanding is that we are still on the Phase 1 (PoC). Phase 1 ends with TASK-014, as currently specified in `TODO.md`. After Phase 1 (PoC) we should proceed into Phase 2 (MCP Server Extraction & Productization). Afterwards, we continue as original planned thru Phase #3-5  
  
  Q8.1: After TASK-014 as specified now in `TODO.md`

  Q8.2: We will define that as part of the new MCP Server project. The idea is for MCP Server project to be implemented using defined strategy, in the same way as PoC project.

  On TODO.md → PLAN.md Rename:

  Q9: Rename affects many file references. Should I:
  - Keep TODO.md name for consistency with common conventions
