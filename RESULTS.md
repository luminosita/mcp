Key Highlights

Strategic Objective:
"Establish production-ready AI agent infrastructure using Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables enterprise development teams to deploy agentic AI systems in weeks instead of months"

5 Key Results (OKRs):
1. 50+ production deployments across 20+ organizations by Q4 2025
2. Time-to-production reduced from 8-12 weeks to under 2 weeks (>75% reduction)
3. 1000+ GitHub stars demonstrating developer interest
4. Zero security incidents with <0.1% error rate
5. Tool integration time reduced from 40 hours to under 2 hours (>95% reduction)

5 Supporting Epics:
1. EPIC-001: Project Management Integration (Q1-Q2)
2. EPIC-002: Organizational Knowledge Access (Q1-Q2)
3. EPIC-003: Secure Authentication & Authorization (Q2)
4. EPIC-004: Production-Ready Observability (Q2-Q3)
5. EPIC-005: Automated Deployment Configuration (Q3)

Resource Commitment:
- Budget: $800K-$1.2M over 12 months
- Team: 2.5 FTE (Phase 1) → 6.5 FTE (Phase 3)
- Organizational Capacity: ~5-7% of engineering capacity

✅ TASK-009 Complete: 5 Epics v1 Generated

Terminal Artifacts: 5 epic documents (2,221 total lines)

Epic Summary

| Epic ID  | Title                                 | Priority                      | Timeline           | Effort    | Complexity  |
|----------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|-------------|
| EPIC-001 | Project Management Integration        | Critical (MVP)                | Q1-Q2 (6-8 weeks)  | 60-80 SP  | Medium      |
| EPIC-002 | Organizational Knowledge Access       | Critical (MVP)                | Q1-Q2 (8-10 weeks) | 80-100 SP | High        |
| EPIC-003 | Secure Authentication & Authorization | Critical (MVP, blocks others) | Q2 (8-10 weeks)    | 70-90 SP  | High        |
| EPIC-004 | Production-Ready Observability        | Critical (MVP)                | Q2-Q3 (6-8 weeks)  | 60-75 SP  | Medium-High |
| EPIC-005 | Automated Deployment Configuration    | High (V1)                     | Q3 (6-7 weeks)     | 50-65 SP  | Medium      |

Key Highlights

Epic Dependencies:
- EPIC-003 (Auth) must complete early (Month 2-4) to unblock:
- EPIC-001 (needs auth framework for PM tool credentials)
- EPIC-002 (needs auth framework and ACL enforcement)

Total Effort: 320-410 story points (~7-9 months for full team)

Critical Path: EPIC-003 → EPIC-001/002 (parallel) → EPIC-004 → EPIC-005

Highest Complexity: EPIC-002 (Organizational Knowledge Access)
- RAG pipeline, vector databases, ACL enforcement
- 80-100 SP, 8-10 weeks, high technical complexity

Strategic Blockers: EPIC-003 (Auth) is critical path—delays cascade to EPIC-001, EPIC-002

Validation Status (All Epics)

✅ All template sections present (per epic-template.xml)
- Epic statement (user-focused, business value articulated)
- Business value (user impact, business impact quantified)
- Problem being solved (from Product Vision)
- Scope (in/out explicitly defined)
- High-level user stories (3-5 per epic, preliminary)
- Epic-level acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then format)
- Success metrics (targets, measurement methods)
- Technical considerations (dependencies, risks, architecture impact)
- Effort estimation (SP range, duration, team size)
- Milestones (3 per epic across timeline)
- Definition of Done
- Open questions

✅ Traceability: All epics map to Product Vision key capabilities with explicit section references

✅ Implementation-Agnostic: Epics stay at strategic level—no detailed technical design

✅ Dependencies Mapped: EPIC-003 blocks EPIC-001, EPIC-002 clearly documented
