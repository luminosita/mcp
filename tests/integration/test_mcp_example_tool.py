"""
Integration tests for example tool via MCP protocol.

This test module demonstrates integration testing patterns for MCP tools:
- Testing tools through FastAPI application
- Validating MCP protocol integration
- Testing tool discovery and invocation
- Verifying end-to-end tool execution
- Testing with real application dependencies (minimal mocking)

WHY INTEGRATION TESTS:
While unit tests validate business logic in isolation, integration tests ensure
the tool works correctly when integrated with FastAPI, FastMCP, and application
middleware. These tests catch integration issues that unit tests miss.

NOTE: Integration tests use the real application instance but may mock external
services to keep tests fast and deterministic.
