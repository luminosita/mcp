## Phase 1.6: Generator Architecture Refinement - Completed Tasks

### TASK-015: Refactor Initiative Generator to Handle INIT-000 (Foundation Initiative)
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: None (architectural improvement)
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Context**: Current session

**Description**:
Refactor initiative-generator to convert existing EPIC-000 instructions into INIT-000 (Foundation Initiative) instructions. The initiative generator should check if INIT-000 exists before generating feature initiatives (INIT-001+), and recommend creating INIT-000 first if it doesn't exist.

**Completion Notes:**
- ✅ Updated initiative-generator.xml (v1.5 → v1.8)
  - v1.6: Added Step 1 INIT-000 detection, split Step 6 into 6A/6B routing
  - v1.7: Removed redundant Step 2 routing logic, cleaned up step sequence
  - v1.8: Made Step 6A fully tech-agnostic (CRITICAL architectural refinement)
    - Removed specific technologies (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Python, pytest)
    - Added tech-agnostic language guidance and examples
    - Added anti-hallucination guideline for maintaining tech-agnostic language
    - **Rationale:** Initiatives/Epics are STRATEGIC PHASE (business-focused, tech-agnostic). Technical decisions belong in PRD phase where Implementation Research is available.
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md SDLC Artifact Dependency Flow diagram
  - Explicitly shows INIT-000 (Foundation Initiative) with EPIC-000
  - Shows INIT-001+ (Feature Initiatives) with EPIC-001+ and INIT-000 dependency
  - Added Key Principles clarifying INIT-000 vs INIT-001+ distinction
- ✅ Verified epic-generator.xml handles INIT-000 correctly (no changes needed)
  - Already supports Initiative as parent via mutually exclusive inputs
- ✅ Created INIT-000 artifact (needs regeneration with tech-agnostic language)
- Generator architecture now clean: Product Vision → INIT-000 (foundation) & INIT-001+ (features)
- **Architectural Decision:** Strategic Phase = Tech-Agnostic, PRD = Tech-Aware Bridge

**Architectural Rationale:**
- Product Vision remains initiative-agnostic (strategic, no initiatives generated)
- Initiative Generator handles ALL initiative creation (foundation + features)
- INIT-000 (Foundation Initiative) contains EPIC-000 as single supporting epic
- INIT-001+ (Feature Initiatives) depend on INIT-000 as prerequisite
- Clean separation at initiative level: foundation bootstrap vs. feature delivery
- Aligns with decision to create separate INIT-000 for foundation/bootstrap work

**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Context**: Current session

**Description**:
Incorporate feedback from `/feedback/PRD-000_v1_comments.md` into PRD-000 v2. Update Technical Considerations section to align with specialized CLAUDE.md standards and incorporate additional tooling requirements and answered Open Questions.

- Updated FR-13, FR-14, FR-17 to reference Podman as primary (Docker alternative)
- Updated Dependencies section with new tooling
- Updated Technology Stack Appendix with new tools and rationale
- Updated Timeline to 5 weeks (comprehensive foundation per Decision D1)
- EPIC-000 evaluation: Minor alignment needed (duration 4→5 weeks, milestones, open questions resolved) but strategic scope remains valid and tech-agnostic ✅

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: None (architectural improvement)
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Context**: Current session

**Description**:
Add implementation-phase routing instructions to existing CLAUDE.md and move implementation configuration files from `/implementation/` to `/prompts/CLAUDE/`. Main CLAUDE.md stays intact with planning-phase instructions, just adds routing to implementation configs.

**Completion Notes:**
- Created `/prompts/CLAUDE/` directory
- Moved 6 CLAUDE-*.md files from `/implementation/` to `/prompts/CLAUDE/`:
  - CLAUDE-core.md
  - CLAUDE-tooling.md
  - CLAUDE-testing.md
  - CLAUDE-typing.md
  - CLAUDE-validation.md
  - CLAUDE-architecture.md
- Added "Implementation Phase Instructions" section to main `/CLAUDE.md` at end
- Cross-references use relative paths (`./CLAUDE-*.md`) - no updates needed
- Implementation TODO.md stays in `/implementation/` for implementation-specific tracking
- Main CLAUDE.md retains all planning instructions, now includes routing to implementation configs

**Output Artifacts:**
- Updated `/CLAUDE.md` (existing planning content + new implementation routing section)
- `/prompts/CLAUDE/CLAUDE-core.md` (moved from /implementation/)
- `/prompts/CLAUDE/CLAUDE-tooling.md` (moved)
- `/prompts/CLAUDE/CLAUDE-testing.md` (moved)
- `/prompts/CLAUDE/CLAUDE-typing.md` (moved)
