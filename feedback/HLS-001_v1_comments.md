## Decisions Made

### Open Questions

**High-Level Story Open Questions focus on USER/UX/FUNCTIONAL uncertainties needing validation before backlog refinement.**

1. **Should setup script include IDE/editor configuration, or leave that to developer preference?**

Decision: System setup script (dotfiles) will initial IDE editor configuration. We standardize on Visual Studio Code with extensions. IDE Setup with extensions must be clearly documented. Developers are free to install additional extensions

2. **Do developers prefer verbose output showing every step, or concise output with progress indicators?** [REQUIRES UX DESIGN]
Decision: Verbose with progress indicators

3. **Should the setup script offer interactive prompts for configuration options, or use sensible defaults?** [REQUIRES PRODUCT OWNER]

Decision: Interactive prompts for config options with sensible defaults for silent setup
