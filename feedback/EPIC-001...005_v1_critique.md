# Epic 001-005 (covers multiple epics) Critique

## CR1: Technical Considerations

## Clarity
Technical Considerations section is too technical for a strategic phase document (Epic). Epic generator prompt expects only business research document as input. Implementation research document is out of the scope for epic generation. All generated epics has this section, which should be part of PRD document (business and implementation bridge). General technical terms (JWT, API key, OAuth 2.0) are acceptable since they represent generic domain terminology. Avoiding that terminology would be nearly impossible to describe epics. Specific techologies as covered in technical considertions are unnecessary for epics.
