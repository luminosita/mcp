# Initiative 001 (Production-Ready AI Agent Infrastructure)

## CR1: Missing project ground work

### Completeness
Created epics focus on specific aspects, which add value to the overall initiative and the product. We are lacking something like Epic-000 within this first initiative, which is the initial setup of the repository structure, ground work of the project (main entry point, architecture setup, main framework).

### Steps
- Comprehensive research on the aspect of project initialization, ground work, framework setup, AI-assisted context (CLAUDE.md files) as part of the overall SDLC workflow

### Open Questions
- Q1: Should project initialization and bootstrap be part of the SDLC workflow?
- Q2: Do we define epic for that starting stage?

### Severity
Critical
