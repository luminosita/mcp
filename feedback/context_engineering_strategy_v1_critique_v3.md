## Critiques

- C1: give clear instructions for main strategy document update and cleanup, which will be used as a context in the new session
- C2: execute-generator should be updated to use {task_type} metadata instead of {task_name}, since we already updated TODO.md with that additional field
- C3: evaluate if we specify instructions in prompts that human must confirm all ASSUMPTIONS before proceeding

**CRITICAL** Analyze my critiques, and perform clarification loop by asking questions until all statements are clarified. Give clear answer to evaluate requests. Only proceed with updates upon confirmation.
