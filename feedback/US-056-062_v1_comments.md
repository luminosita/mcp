### Implementation Guidance Step 1

**Issue:**
Validate Generated Artifact
`manual_review_required`, `requires_manual_review` flags should be `agent_review_required`, `requires_agent_review`

**Solution:**

Expect `agent_review_required`, `requires_agent_review`flags in response for validation tool. If found AI Agent should perform validation on items specified in response

**Rationale:**
Readability checks and appropriateness of content should be done by AI Agent first. AI Agent can flag for further human review. We should first perform deterministic validation via script (tool), then AI Agent content review and finally human review only if needed.
